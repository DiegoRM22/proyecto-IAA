12;begin forwarded text Date: Wed, 25 Sep 2002 13:57:15 -0400 To: Digital Bearer Settlement List From: R. A. Hettinga Subject: California needs intelligent energy deregulation Sender: http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/4144696.htm?template=contentModules/printstory.jspPosted on Tue, Sep. 24, 2002 Dan Gillmor: State needs intelligent energy deregulationBy Dan Gillmor Mercury News Technology ColumnistThe facts were trade and government secrets at the time. But the energy industry failed the smell test in 2000 and 2001 as it tried to justify soaring wholesale electricity and natural-gas prices in California.Now, as investigators and regulators unravel the reasons for a financial and fiscal mess we'll be cleaning up for decades, we're learning what everyone suspected. Market games helped engineer the price spikes.The latest manipulation was highlighted in Monday's finding by a federal administrative law judge, who said a dominant natural-gas company squeezed supplies in order to squeeze customers. His ruling came a few days after California's Public Utilities Commission reported that electricity generators mysteriously failed to use available capacity during the crunch, also driving up prices.And don't forget the sleazy games by energy traders who gleefully worked the system, in schemes best summed up by an Enron insider's boast in a memorandum made public in May, that ``Enron gets paid for moving energy to relieve congestion without actually moving any energy or relieving any congestion.''How much of this was illegal, as opposed to simply amoral, remains to be seen. Unfortunately, California's response -- confusion, lawsuits and policy tweaks -- hasn't been sufficient.More unfortunately, even if the state suddenly did all the right things -- including a hard-nosed program designed to free ourselves from the gougers' grips -- we would need a willing federal partner. But it's foolish to think that the Bush administration would do much to help one of its least favorite states, or do anything that conflicts with its love of traditional, non-renewable energy sources.If the lawsuits against various energy companies and traders bear any fruit, the best we can expect is to pay off some of the massive debts the state amassed to prevent a total collapse in early 2001. That's a reasonable approach, but don't expect miracles.State policies are moving the wrong way on utility regulation, meanwhile. Instead of relentlessly pursuing smart deregulation -- still a good idea if it gives customers genuine choices -- state laws and regulations ``put the utilities back in the business of buying energy for captive customers,'' notes V. John White, executive director of the Sacramento-based Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies (www.ceert.org).It's tempting to call for an outright state takeover of the utilities -- tempting but a bad idea. When there's genuine competition, as we could achieve in electricity generation, the private sector tends to do a better job. Instead of abandoning deregulation, California should find a way to inject real competition into the market.We do need to recognize that the current system of delivering electricity defies privatization, at least under current conditions. Smart regulation is essential.But the best response to gouging is to use less of what the gougers control. There are two ways: conservation and replacement. We need more of both.The best recent step is a new state law that slowly but surely ratchets up the use of electricity from renewables. By 2017, California's utilities will have to get 20 percent of their power from solar and other renewable sources. Several power companies are expected to do this even sooner.But this law has an element of old-line thinking, the captive-customer model we need to be getting away from, not sustaining. Lip service to newer ideas isn't enough.The state should be removing barriers to micro-generation systems, small generators that can run on a variety of fuels and provide decentralized, harder-to-disrupt electricity to homes and businesses. This technology is coming along fast. State policies are not keeping pace.Investing to save energy is increasingly the smartest move of all. California should be doing more to encourage this, whether through tax incentives or outright grants in low-income households. California hasn't done badly on conservation in a general sense, and energy customers did react to last year's soaring rates and blackouts by cutting back, but it's lunacy to wait for the next crisis when we can do something to avoid it altogether.Maybe this is all pointless. The Bush administration's energy policies, so grossly tilted toward the unholy trinity of oil, coal and nuclear, are making us all more vulnerable. Never mind what might happen if the coming war in Iraq goes badly.It's pointless to hope for a sane federal policy -- a crash program to drastically speed the inevitable transition to a hydrogen-based energy system. But the largest state, one of the world's major economies in its own right, does have some clout. We can hit the rip-off artists where it hurts, and protect ourselves from even more serious disruptions. Maybe next year.-- ----------------- R. A.

support for legislation that will be center-stage in the next session.
This is an opportunity to ask your representative to take a stand for
your rights. Ask her/him to co-sponsor the DMCRA today!Representatives Rick Boucher and John Doolittle recently introduced
the Digital Media Consumers' Rights Act (DMCRA, H.R. 5544), which
would require labelling on usage-impaired copy-protected compact
discs and would make several several amendments to 1998's infamous
Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).Take action here:

2002 (S. 2395, also known as the Biden Bill). It started as an
attempt to stop organized crime from forging holograms and
counterfeiting money, but its scope has been greatly expanded to
include digital watermarks on copyrighted material. This is a sneaky
power-grab that would greatly diminish the rights of the public in
copyrighted works while expanding the power of copyright owners. It
goes well beyond the scope of current copyright law and could:~ Prevent universities, libraries, and consumers from enjoying the
exceptions to the Copyright Act adopted by Congress. S. 2935 could
prohibit the use of interface information essential for software
interoperability and competition~ Impose new responsibilities on Internet service providers and could
also require consumer electronics and computer manufacturers to
reconfigure their products.~ Impose more severe criminal and civil penalties than permitted by
the Copyright Act for identical behaviorThis anticounterfeiting bill is a decoy, stand up for your rights
today! Subscribe to the EFF Action Center and send your member of

http://www.eff.org/support/-=end=-----------------------------------------------------------* Canadian Trademark Law OverreachingEFF has been involved in several cases involving overreaching
trademark claims on the Internet. Recently we have learned about a
Canadian lawsuit over the website www.lawsnet.com, a nonprofit legal
information website focusing on the laws of Canada and China that seem
especially egregious.Lawsnet.com is a free legal information website that has been
published since 1998. Last year, Lawsnet.com's owner Ling Xia was sued
by Quicklaw, a subsidiary of global publishing giant LexisNexus Group.
Quicklaw claims that Lawsnet.com violates its rights in the name
LAW/NET. However, LAW/NET does not have a public Internet website
under that domain name. The name appears on a subsidiary webpage of
the Quicklaw.com website that offers public teasers in the form of
summaries of recent Canadian cases, with the full text only available
through the private, proprietary paid Quicklaw service for Canadian
lawyers. It seems clear that the two names are substantially
different, are used in different places (one as a teaser for a closed
computer service and the other for information freely available on the
public internet) and are not causing any consumer confusion. Even more
problematic, Quicklaw does not even have a Canadian trademark in the
term LAW/NET -- it applied for one in 1997 but has repeatedly filed
requests for extensions of time with the Canadian trademark
authorities. In contrast, Ms. Xia is in the final stages of having a
Canadian trademark issued for lawsnet.Regardless of its weak case, Quicklaw has managed to drag Ms. Xia
through over a year of litigation and recently succeeded in securing a
court order requiring her to undergo an extensive discovery process
that threatens to drive her under. Although she has had some free
legal assistance in the past, this next phase will require
significantly more legal resources than her volunteer attorneys can
muster. Quicklaw is represented by a large Toronto firm, Borden Ladner
and Gervais, LLP.Abuse of trademark law (even here, when no official trademark has even
been granted) is a growing problem on the Internet, and it is
unfortunately becoming an international problem. EFF urges Quicklaw,
and its US-based parent company, to stop beating up on this free and
useful website. While trademark law is important when misuse of a mark
is causing consumer confusion, it does not -- and should not -- grant
ownership in words, especially descriptive words like laws and net
when describing an online legal information service. Trademark law
should also not be a license for large corporations who sell legal
information (or any other nonproprietary information) to stop
individuals who want to use the power of the Internet to provide free
legal information to the public.For those who wish to help Ms. Xia directly, local Toronto lawyer and
part-time law professor Gil Lan has agreed to act as trustee for a
legal defence fund to be established for Ms. Xia. If you wish to help,

30;sle 31 call for papers , sle 31 , st andrews , scotland , 26-30 august 1998 workshop on modality in generative grammar the description and analysis of modality is of central interest to the study of human language . modality interacts with many subsystems of syntax and a better understanding of modality would further our understanding of these subsystems greatly . the relevant subsystems play a role in the existing analyses of the epistemic-deontic dichotomy . this has been attributed to : ( i ) argument structure ( e . g . ross 1969 ) : epistemic modals are one-place predicates ( corresponding to raising verbs syntactically ) , whereas deontic modals are two-place predicates ( corresponding to control verbs syntactically ) . ( ii ) insertion position : epistemic modals are generated in i , deontic modals in v ( e . g . picallo 1990 ) . ( iii ) lf position : epistemic modals are in c , deontic modals in vp ( e . g . mcdowell 1987 ) . ( iv ) nature of the complement of a modal : a definite verbal complement with epistemic modals and an indefinite verbal complement with deontic modals ( e . g . barbiers 1995 ) . v ) pragmatics : the dichotomy is contextually determined and does not correspond to a syntactic difference ( kratzer 1989 ) . many questions still need to be answered before a sufficiently adequate analysis can be developed . as for argument structure , it should be asked what evidence we have that each modal has two different argument structures . if such evidence exists , are these argument structures represented in the lexicon , as in theta-theoretic accounts , or only syntactically ? related questions concern the categorial status of modals ( a special category aux in english , but main verbs in german and dutch ) , the selectional restrictions they impose on their complement ( semantically uniform , but not syntactically : only verbal complements in english , no categorial restrictions in dutch , verbal and certain prepositional complements in german and afrikaans ) . as for their syntactic position at surface structure or lf , we need to know more about the ( scopal ) interaction of modals with negation . it is clear that there is a tight connection between modality and negation / affirmation : many languages have a modal that behaves as an negative polarity item ( english ` need ' , german ` brauchen ' , dutch ` hoeven ' ) . a related issue is the interaction of modals with focus particles , especially those that have a negative or affirmative import , such as english ` only ' or french ` bien ' . it seems that such focus particles can alter the syntactic and semantic behaviour of modals . the ( scopal ) interaction of modals with other quantifiers and modals with question operators is also in need of a better description and analysis . it has been claimed that question formation and epistemic modality exclude each other . although this does not seem to hold in general , question formation and epistemic modality do seem to restrict each other in ways that are poorly understood . the interaction of modal verbs with modal adverbials is also relevant for the determination of the syntactic position of modals , particulary in view of cinque 's ( 1997 ) hypothesis that every sentence contains two modal projections that must be either filled by a modal adverbial in the specifier or by a modal verb in the head . many languages have a construction with ` have to ' or ` be to ' that involves a modal interpretation . such constructions do not generally have an epistemic interpretation ( but consider english ` he was never to see her again ' , dutch ` het is te verwachten dat . . . ' ` it is to be expected that . . . ' ) . there are a great many cross-linguistic peculiarities on this point , which are worth exploring . for example , one question is how this type of construction , lacking a visible modal element , yields a modal interpretation . there is a more general question concerning modality : which properties of modals are necessary for modality and which are accidental ? cross - linguistically , modals often have a irregular present tense inflection paradigm . it is unclear whether this is a necessary property of modals and if so , why . the fact that english modals are auxilaries but modals in other languages are not is presumably an accidental property , and so is the fact that english modals lack infinitives and participles in their paradigm , whereas dutch modals do have infinitival and participial forms ( except for the verb ` zullen ' ` will ' ) . as it seems that the bulk of generative studies of modality involves germanic languages , we particularly invite papers on modality in romance and central european languages . organizers : sjef barbiers ( leiden ) , frits beukema ( leiden ) , olga tomic ( novi sad ) , milena milojevic sheppard ( ljubljana ) , marija golden ( ljubljana ) . please submit abstract ( 1 a4 max ) to : professor olga miseska tomic bulevar avnoja 109 / iii , stan 16 beograd yu 11070 yugoslavija e - mail : efilb01 @ yubgss21 . bg . ac . yu & dr sjef barbiers hil / department of dutch studies p . n . van eyckhof 3 leiden , nl 2300 ra the netherlands e - mail : barbiers @ rullet . leidenuniv . nl & dr frits beukema hil / department of english p . n . van eyckhof 4 leiden , nl 2300 ra the netherlands e - mail : beukema @ rullet . leidenuniv . nl closing date for submission of abstract : 15 may 1998 date of acceptance / rejection of abstract : 1 july 1998;Safe Email

33;release of agfl home page this message announces the release of the world wide web home page of agfl ( affix grammars over a finite lattice ) . 1 . agfl the agfl formalism , developed at the university of nijmegen , the netherlands , is a formalism in which context free grammars can be described compactly . agfls are two level grammars : a first , context free level is augmented with features for expressing agreement between parts of speech . features are treated as types , and their values may range over the subsets of a given finite set , which explains the acronym affix grammars over a finite lattice . agfl grammars are transformed into a parser by the parser generator opt . the generated parser is a recursive backup parser which computes the values of the affixes on the fly . in this way , fast and efficient parsers can be generated . the formalism is quite simple and limited , and therefore easy to read and write . agfl comes with a grammar workbench gwb , supporting the development of grammars and the checking of their consistency . the agfl formalism does not require any special hardware . the parser generator opt runs on regular sparc - systems and ms-dos machines ( 386 or higher ) and is relatively small . for instance , the ms-dos version requires less than 1 mb harddisk space . 2 . agfl on the web agfl has now been made available to the ( computational ) linguistic community . we think it can be used by ( computational ) linguists who are in need of a simple grammar formalism with a fast parser generator , suitable for experimental purposes . therefore , we have made agfl available via ftp and , recently , via www . the agfl home page contains information about the agfl formalism like the agfl manual , documentation and papers , sample grammars and the latest developments . there is also the possibility to download the software and to register yourself as an agfl user . you are invited to take a look at the home page and to read the information or to download the software . please feel free to make use of agfl and its home page , we look forward to hear about your experiences . we are currently planning an agfl workshop in june . the latest news about this workshop can also be found on the agfl home page . the url of the agfl home page is : http : / / www . cs . kun . nl / agfl / the address of the ftp - site is : ftp : / / hades . cs . kun . nl / pub / agfl / the organisation of the www page should be self-explanatory . the structure of the ftp - site is as follows : - readme - doc : this directory contains a number of relevant papers - pc386 : this directory contains software for ms-dos machines and an installation guide . - sun4 : this directory contains software for sparc - stations and an installation guide . any questions or remarks with respect to agfl or the agfl home page can be sent to : www-agfl @ cs . kun . nl . on behalf of the agfl team , erik oltmans department of computer science university of nijmegen the netherlands;Safe Email

38;Thanks Brent: now it's clearer (to me) what's needed. I've used the global
sort and J C Lawrence's re-scan, but there is still a vulnerability there:
If I have an instance of exmh running, the folder I'm visiting will have
its new, correct .xmhcache overwritten with an incorrect one when I switch
folders. I can cron the sort and re-scan process, but I should kill running
exmh's first.Best would be to have a button for Global sort and update all scan caches
in the exmh More... menu--

39;re : 6 . 381 words that are their own opposites several people submitted  overlook  and  oversight  , which are fine examples of this phenomenon in english ( though i think that mary neff 's  outgoing : retiring  is perhaps the most elegant submission to date . ) perhaps my current work on the various shades of meaning in english prepositions has biased me , but in any case i think that the difference in the various senses of  oversight  and  overlook  stems largely from their compounding with  over -  .  over  is sneaky , at first glance it seems to be fairly limited in expressive power , but deeper analysis reveals that in it lurk a number of distinctions of meaning , some of them quite subtle indeed . in addition to nuances of physical location ,  over  can indicate power relationships ( both outright force , and more subtle authority ) , value judgements , and the general notion of ( metaphorically ) moving on to another thing , as in  get over it  and  skip over  . so my analysis of  oversight  and  overlook  would be that in one sense ,  over  takes on the meaning of authority-over , and in the other sense it takes on the meaning of skipping-over . perhaps a similar argument could be make for the  sight / see / look  part of the compound ? for instance , useages such as  see to it   look to your own interest  seem to carry some of this  authority  meaning . i think the  over  analysis is more clear-cut , but it would be interesting to see if someone will make a case for the other half . - - marion kee marion kee  all opinions are my own , knowledge engineer , center for machine translation  when cmu wants my opinions carnegie mellon university pittsburgh , pa , usa  it pays for them .;Safe Email

difference that I could see from staring at the false negative rate.
The numbers are big enough that a quick eyeball suffices.Then I tried a dirt simple tokenizer for the headers that tokenize the
words in the header and emitted like this %s: %s % (hdr, word).
That worked too well :-).  The received and date headers helped the
classifier discover that most of my spam is old and most of my ham is
new.So I tried a slightly more complex one that skipped received, data,
and x-from_, which all contained timestamps.  I also skipped the X-VM-
headers that my mail reader added:class MyTokenizer(Tokenizer):    skip = {'received': 1,
            'date': 1,
            'x-from_': 1,
            }    def tokenize_headers(self, msg):
        for k, v in msg.items():
            k = k.lower()
            if k in self.skip or k.startswith('x-vm'):
                continue
            for w in subject_word_re.findall(v):
                for t in tokenize_word(w):
                    yield %s:%s % (k, t)This did moderately better.  The false negative rate is 7-21% over the
tests performed so far.  This is versus 11-28% for the previous test
run that used the timtest header tokenizer.It's interesting to see that the best descriminators are all ham
discriminators.  There's not a single spam-indicator in the list.
Most of the discriminators are header fields.  One thing to note is
that the presence of Mailman-generated headers is a strong non-spam
indicator.  That matches my intuition: I got an awful lot of
Mailman-generated mail, and those lists are pretty good at surpressing
spam.  The other thing is that I get a lot of ham from people who use
XEmacs.  That's probably Barry, Guido, Fred, and me :-).One final note.  It looks like many of the false positives are from
people I've never met with questions about Shakespeare.  They often
start with stuff like:> Dear Sir/Madam,
> 
> May I please take some of your precious time to ask you to help me to find a
> solution to a problem that is worrying me greatly. I am old science studentI guess that reads a lot like spam :-(.Jeremy

64;closing linguistics at soas call for help ! ! ! soas department of phonetics and linguistics to be closed in october 1992 dear colleagues , on tuesday may 19 , dr david bennett , head of our department , was told that we would cease functioning as of october of this year . we are a department of the school of oriental and african studies of the university of london . the members of our department are : dr david bennett prof thea bynon dr wynn chao dr monik charette dr katrina hayward dr richard hayward * dr george hewitt * * dr bruce ingham prof jonathan kaye prof ruth kempson * cross appointed with the africa department * * cross appointed with the near and middle east department our department offers degrees at the ba , ma , mphil and phd level . approximately 60 students , mostly at the postgraduate level are enrolled . many other students , particularly from university college , london ( ucl ) take courses with us . we run an ma - linguistics and an ma - phonetics programme jointly with ucl . we also have an ma in english - arabic applied linguistics and translation together with birbeck college . all these programmes will of course be affected by this decision . the department of phonetics and linguistics is the oldest linguistic department in the u . k . it was the home of the  london school  which received worldwide attention under the intellectual leadership of prof jr firth . his chair , which i occupy today , was the first chair of linguistics in the u . k . over the years our graduates have distinguished themselves in many areas of linguistics . later postings will provide a partial list of the more well known soas graduates . it is acknowledged , even by the administration of soas , that we remain a centre of academic excellence in our field . the decision to close the soas linguistics department was made with no consultation , no advanced warning . it was a result of discussions by the governing body of the school , the finance and general purposes committee and the management committee . there is no linguistic representation on any of these bodies . the reasons given for closing the department are : ( 1 ) severe budget cuts ( 2 ) our low number of undergraduate students ( 3 ) the  general perception  that our department is not well integrated into the school . it was stated that , among the options considered closing our department would cause the  least harm  to the school . no one was present to represent the linguistics side of the story . this decision will be presented to the academic board of the school on wednesday may 27 . the academic board has an advisory role only but we are hoping to mobilise school opinion against this decision . unlike similar cases in other countries , most of the members of our department will not be redeployed elsewhere in the school . recent legislation has virtually destroyed the notion of tenure in the u . k . many of us are facing  premature retirement  ,  redundancy  or some form of  severance  agreement . the administration of the school seems to feel that we will easily find jobs and that terminating our employment at the school will cause us no undue hardships . given the administration 's figures for the cost of severing their relation with us , the offers that we are likely to receive from the school will not be very attractive . as of now , no statement has been forthcoming about our future at the school but the director has stated that he will be meeting with us individually next week . we will keep you posted on this aspect . if you would like to do something to try and help us stop the closing of our department , please send ( in order of preference ) a fax or a letter to me at the address and fax number given below . if possible use your institution 's letterhead . please feel free to make comments about our department as a whole or about individual members with whose work or reputation you are familiar . pass this message along to your colleagues and encourage them to write as well . if you feel so inclined , departmental resolutions reflecting your opinion of this event would be quite helpful . i hope to be able to arrive at next wednesday 's meeting with an armful of your letters ( copies of all letters will be sent to our director ) and your support will do a lot to improve our spirits . this will be a long and difficult struggle both for our department and for our jobs and careers . thank you in advance for listening and for your support . jonathan kaye professor of general linguistics department of phonetics & linguistics school of oriental and african studies thornhaugh street , russell square london , wc1h 0xg u . k . e-mail : jk @ ukacrl . earn jk @ uk . ac . rl . ib ( janet ) fax number : ( 44 ) + 71-436 - 3844;Safe Email

71;Looks and sounds a hell of a lot like Clare's cat, Violence...A tall tail or is it a prowling panther?
http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/weird/display.var.633939.Bizarre+London.0.html
Security cameras at the Gardiner house filmed the cat
The Plumstead panther has been spotted just yards from the scene of a 
sighting made three weeks ago but this time it was caught on camera.Steve Gardiner, 41, claims to have spotted the large cat in his garden in 
Upton Road, Plumstead, in the sixth reported sighting in Woolwich and Bexley 
in just four weeks.Mr Gardiner told News Shopper he watched the big cat as it walked alongside 
the house at about 7.15am, on Wednesday, September 25, while his security 
cameras captured it on film.The father-of-four described the black cat as about 3ft long and 
two-and-a-half-foot high, with a large body.He said: It prowled past the patio doors moving with all the mannerisms of 
a hunter.It looked at me calmly before moving on.The bricklayer told how his work colleagues let him know News Shopper had 
been following the big cat story so he decided to call our offices with news 
of the sighting.His wife, Karen, 41, later checked the tape which had captured grainy images 
of the large cat prowling through their garden.She said: I feel sorry for it not living in its natural habitat I'd hate 
for it to get hurt.Mr Gardiner told how he is convinced of the cat's existence saying how their 
usually quiet 18-year-old dog barks at nothing in the garden but barked 
that morning.He warned: I don't think these cats are dangerous but, if cornered, they 
might jump you.Sightings of the large black cat are being reported all over the Plumstead 
Common and Shooters Hill as well at the Bexley area.If you have seen the big cat, call News Shopper on 01689 885712.12:27 Tuesday 8th October 2002_________________________________________________________________

75;re : 5 . 1237 sum : basic word order ( and remarks on typology ) fritz newmeyer raises some important issues about typological research as instantiated in nichols ' work and elsewhere , which call for some comments . first , the notion of language type is an idealization : this is often made clear in typology courses , where non-existent artificial languages are considered as logically possible or impossible language types , if not always in the published literature ( though the point is clearly made in comrie 's textbook , for example , by the discussion of morphological typology ) . similarly , fritz is quite right to point out that the assumption of no areal or genetic bias , to the extent that it is made at all , is a counterfactual one . what i would ask is whether such idealizations differ in kind from those , many of them counterfactual , which underlie generative grammar . the justification is similar in both cases : methodologically , one cannot deal with all the relevant variables all the time , and some of the concepts used are logically independent of the extrinsic variables , e . g . one can investigate consistency with proposed implicational universals regardless of the statistical bias in one 's sample . the term ` shaky typological pigeon-holing ' is particularly inapt as applied to nichols ' distinction between head-marking and dependent - marking languages , which is quite explicitly a matter of degree ( see her 1986 paper where the degree of hm vs . dm is quantifified in terms of the number of patterns instantiating each type ) . if nichols refers to a ` head-marking language ' this is shorthand for a quantifiable tendency , just as we might describe italian as a ` pro-drop language ' without implying that there is a binary distinction here ( in fact there are degrees of pro-drop , e . g . some languages allow null expletives but not null referential subjects , etc ) . another point which i think all typologists would accept is that languages which do n't appear to match an established type are typological data - for example , colloquial french as discussed recently on linguist is a language which might reasonably be described as having no basic word order ( i believe that nichols classified it as vso in one of her tables , but that is again shorthand for a more complex situation ) . this is an explanandum for which nichols ' 1986 paper offers an explanation : head-marking facilitates word order freedom , and colloquial french instantiates clausal head-marking in nichols ' sense . to sum up : pace widespread opinion , typologists ' goal is not pigeon-holing (  taxonomy  is also widely used in this context ! ) but the investigation and explanation of patterns of variation . steve matthews;Safe Email

77;esther torrego , the dependencies of objects for more information please visit http : / / mitpress . mit . edu / promotions / books / tordpf98 the dependencies of objects esther torrego this monograph investigates the nature , properties , and consequences of the grammatical constraints that yield overt marking of objects in a variety of languages . the author , working within the minimalist program , concentrates on the syntactic and semantic behaviors of a particular class of objects : objects morphologically marked by the dative preposition in romance languages , especially in several spanish dialects , with consideration of similar phenomena in other languages . the central questions addressed revolve around the syntactic derivations that have accusative and dative complements and the role played by  doubling  clitics in these derivations . the analysis , concerned primarily with case theory , unifies syntactic phenomena by isolating the grammatical factors that yield structures with accusative and dative objects . the monograph also includes a discussion of some classical themes of syntactic theory in the romance languages , including asymmetries in the wh-movement of objects with clitics , and causatives . esther torrego is professor of spanish and linguistics at the university of massachusetts , boston . linguistic inquiry monograph 34 september 1998 6 x 9 , 216 pp . paper , isbn 0-262 - 70068 - 9 , cloth , isbn 0-262 - 20112 - 7;Safe Email

Some interesting quotes...http://www.postfun.com/pfp/worbois.html
Thomas Jefferson:I have examined all the known superstitions of the word, and I do not
find in our particular superstition of Christianity one redeeming feature.
They are all alike founded on fables and mythology. Millions of innocent
men, women and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been
burnt, tortured, fined and imprisoned. What has been the effect of this
coercion? To make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites,
to support roguery and error all over the earth.SIX HISTORIC AMERICANS,
by John E. Remsburg, letter to William Short
Jefferson again:Christianity...(has become) the most perverted system that ever shone on
man. ...Rogueries, absurdities and untruths were perpetrated upon the
teachings of Jesus by a large band of dupes and importers led by Paul, the

102;investment / partnership proposal ( very urgent ) good day , i am mr . olufemi olugbade , a bank executive . i am sending this message to you in confidence and i am asking for your favour in the transfer of some money belonging to one mr . barry kelly ( deceased ) whose death we were not aware of until we no longer got replies to our routine notifications to his forwarding address . we were however told by his employers that he died from an automobile crash . now , all attempts to trace his next of kin have proved abortive . there is however no trace in any of his official documents of a next of kin . please understand that the basic line here is that upon the expiration of 6 years , the money would revert to the ownership of the government . please also understand that nobody is ever going to claim this money having 5 and a half years in our bank . so , all i am asking from you is that you should stand in as the next of kin to avoid the money going into the hands of corrupt government officials . also note that it is impossible for the money to leave the coffers of the bank without a next of kin , who also must be a foreigner . further workings of this initiative , and a sharing ratio plus posible areas of investment would be discussed as soon as i hear from you . best regards , olufemi olugbade;Phishing Email

Is there a relatively clean way to dynamically build comp files based on
the path of the current folder?  Yeah, I know exmh will pull the first comp in the path up from the
  current folder to the mail root, but that's not what I want.I'm starting to use plus addressing heavily as part of my SPAM controls.
Specifically I each mailing list with a list-specific address.  eg I would subscribe to this list as claw+exmh@kanga.nu or perhaps
  claw+exmh-users@kanga.nu instead of claw@kanga.nuHowever to do this I need a new set of comp files for each list folder.
As I'm subscribed to something just over 600 lists, that's rather a
pain.  I really don't want to go create and maintain ~1,800 comp files
(components, replcomps, replgroupcomps), especially not as I suspect
I'll be changing or adapting my naming pattern a few times as I adapt
various supporting tools.What would be great is if I could build the relevant comp file
dynamically at runtime.  That way I don't need to maintain a couple
thousand comp files, I just need to make my plus addresses
predictable/computable based (say) on the folder path.  eg I'm currently in folder:    +-Lists-/Products/Exmh-L    The script would dynamically build a compfile which had a From: of
    claw+exmh@kanga.nu for repl, comp, etc.  Similarly when in folder:    +-Lists-/Linux/SVLUG-L  I'd get a From: of claw+svlug@kanga.nuThat way I can use lookup tables for those folders which have multiple
lists being delivered into them.Any ideas how this might be done in an automatic/maintainable fashion?
It would be more than good enough if all I had to do was drop a tiny
FROM_HEADER file in each folder that somehow got picked up by the comp
file...--

This is remarkable for its lack of newsworthiness.1) Bletchley Park used optical sensors, which were (and still are) the best way to read paper tape at high speed. You can read about it in the standard accounts, e.g. http://www.picotech.com/applications/colossus.html2) For decades before that, codebreakers were using optical computing in the form of superposed masks to find patterns. You can read about it in Kahn.3) People have been doing opto-electronic computing for decades. There's a lot more to it than just holography.

bytecodes.  That font is QuickType II, grabbed off my Windows
partition, where it was installed by I-have-no-idea-which-application.Anybody else experimenting with bytecode-enabled freetype, presumably
with different fonts?  Do you find the same bad antialiased rendering
that I found, or do other fonts work well?_______________________________________________

Date: Not suppliedA San Francisco cabbie -- generally a well-educated and firm-opinion-holding 
class of person -- has an essay about a subject near and dear to my 
(non-car-owning) heart: Why is it so damned hard to get a cab in San Francisco? 
    In fact, no cab company ever tells a driver to pick up anyone. When you 
    phone a cab firm in San Francisco, your call is treated not as an order, 
    not as a binding oral contract, but simply as a request...     So, why don't cab companies ensure that we pick you up on time-or at all? 
    In a nutshell, labor law states that if a cab company actually commands a 
    driver to carry out a specific action, that constitutes an 
    employer-employee relationship. But if a company farms its work out to 
    independent contractors, it can rid itself of costly expenses such as 
    disability and social security taxes. It also means that the contractor 
    drivers can't unionize.  Link[1] Discuss[2] (_via CamWorld[3]_)[1] http://www.bradnewsham.com/articles/why_so_hard.shtml

 July 18, 2002						--Janice Chen,						editor in chief,						CNET Reviews
 Dear readers,The majority of PC users may run Windows, but Microsoft can't
touch the passion that Mac users bring to computing. This week,
Apple devotees gathered in New York to find out what their guru,
Steve Jobs, has in store for them. They were not disappointed,
with offerings ranging from the new iMacs, which continue to push
the boundaries of the PC form factor, to updated iPods that
include more memory, better menus, and compatibility with
Windows. Read the 
full coverage from 
CNET's News.com.

PIMs on the side
Whatever happened to the straightforward, dedicated PIM?
   PIM/contact managers, such as the ubiquitous Outlook and
   Lotus, pushed them to the sidelines. But a few PIMs survived
   this enforced obscurity. If you need a plain PIM that doesn't
   cost a fortune, one of these may tickle your fancy.

More in wireless phonesÂ Readers mourn Gene Kan
Peer-to-peer pioneer dies, Macworld kicks off in Manhattan, and
the PayPal/eBay merger is not going so well.--Laura Lindhe, executive editor, CNET Tech Trends
1
Gene Kan:   Gnutella open-source guru Gene Kan, who died on June
   29 in an apparent suicide, was clearly beloved by the CNET
   community. Last week, search requests for information on
   25-year-old Kan far outweighed the kind of requests on
   products and companies I usually see. A pioneer in the
   peer-to-peer space, many credit him with legitimizing file
   sharing--making it about more than music, according to Wired
   News.
2
Macworld:   The annual Apple lovefest in New York is always a
   good show, whether or not Steve Jobs has anything real to
   announce. So far, it looks like Apple has already surprised a
   few by announcing the release of QuickTime 6.0 (see No. 7),
   which many thought would get bogged down in a licensing
   quagmire.
   3
PayPal:
   
   It's been a rocky road thus far for the eBay and
   PayPal deal. Soon after eBay announced it was buying PayPal
   for $1.5 billion, shareholders filed a lawsuit claiming that
   PayPal's price tag was too low. This week, PayPal is being
   subpoenaed by the New York attorney general in regard to its

Wi-Fi:   I'm just going to leave this common term for 802.11 up
   on the Buzz Meter permanently. This time, Wi-Fi is getting
   interest because of a possible pact between tech heavyweights,
   including Intel, AT&T Wireless, and Verizon Communications, to
   build wireless access places across the nation in public areas
   where people would want to launch onto the Net, such as
   airports.

eMac:   This is the for-education-only computer that consumers
   wanted so badly that Apple released it to them. The CNET
   review is out, and here's the word: the eMac is what the iMac
   used to be. Basically, it's an easy-to-use, fairly inexpensive
   computer for users who don't need to do much besides word
   processing and accessing the Web.

Float:Â Â  5 MillionInsider & Institutional Holdings:92% SharesÂ Â Â  CXIN MEDIA CORPORATION, THE BLOOMBERG OF CHINA. - Finance and Investment Magazine, December 2001Â THE COMPANY:CXIN Media Corporation is an integrated media company focusing on the dissemination and aggregation of information. Currently, CXINs core business is in the publishing and aggregation of Financial, Economic, and Business Information on the Peoples Republic of China. The value CXIN Media provides is its ability to source, package, and present information that is highly in demand by the market.Apart from the core print and electronic publishing business, CXIN is involved in other related businesses, such as organizing and managing events such as conferences, seminars, and training in the field of wealth management and personal finance.These areas are closely linked to the core competencies of the company and they intend to leverage on the brands that they have built to further drive the growth potential.CXIN holds the key to success in the Peoples Republic of China. In May of 2001 they acquired the 12 year exclusive right from the China Economic Information Network, a corporation under the direct management of the State Information Center and the State Planning Development Commission, Chinas highest economic decision body.HIGHLIGHTS:May 2001, CXIN acquires the 12 year Exclusive license to distribute all information in English, French and Spanish, Internationally.February 2002, CXIN announced its first distribution contract with a leading market research provider.March 2002, CXIN announces it had signed with yet another distributor for its unique financial , economic and business information on the Peoples Republic of China.Â May 7, 2002, CXIN announces a distribution agreement with Internet Securities, a Euromarket company and the leading provider of emerging market securities.May 9, 2002, CXIN announces it had hired one of Asias top media consulting firms, Telesis, and its President, Mr. Cyril Pereira, the former Director of Operation of the South China Morning Post and Asia Magazine.June 12, 2002, CXIN launched its China Business portal and began selling subscriptions.June 24, 2002, CXIN announces the acquisition ofÂ  Smart Investor Magazine and related business. This magazine will bring over $1.2 Million in consolidated revenues.Â July 15, 2002, CXIN announces the license agreement with Lexis-Nexis, one of the worlds largest aggregators.INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS:According to the reports from Morgan-Stanley, which analyzes the worlds superpowers in 11 industries, it only takes 8 years to build a media empire, which means the return on investment in this industry will be far greater than that of pharmaceutical, household merchandise, energy, or even banking. We believe that CXIN Media is well positioned to become the next superpower of the media market in the fast growing Chinese market. The superior management and its exclusive agreement granted by the Chinese government provide the company with an unfair advantage over its potential competitors. We believe that the recent license agreements signed with some of the largest information providers in the world as well as the Smart Investor Magazines and related business will enable the company to meet its revenue and profit expectation of $50 Million within the next 5 years and dependent on market condition for refinancing, we foresee that CXIN Media could easily double their expected revenue and profits through strategic acquisitions. The current price of the shares do not reflect the value of this growth company, in comparison to the sector CXIN Media should be currently trading between $0.25 to $0.50 and above this value when we take into consideration the growth factors.Disclaimer: The Wall Street Weekly provides information on selected companies that it believes has investment potential.

158;Dear Sir, 
With due respect and humility I write you this letter which I believe you
would
be of great assistance to my children and I.
I got your contact through my husband commercial address book and believed
that
you must be a trust worthy and reliable person that will not like to
intimidate me
or betray my trust after hearing this news. I am a native of KONOBO in the
KEREMA
local district of SIERRA LEONE in West Africa and the wife of Late DR.
MUNDI A.
KOJO who was assassinated by the rebel forced loyal to Major John Paul
Koromah
because he was the Director General National Gold and Diamond Mining
Corporation
of Sierra Leone. Few days before my husband was assassinated, he 
instructed me
and my children (Ibrahim and Amina) to move out of Sierra Leone immediately,
before the powerful Economic community of West African States (ECOMOG)
forces
intervened, which eventually resulted into a brutal civil war. My children
and I
managed to escape to Togo through the help of my husband's friend. We came
into
Togo with some valuables including a cash sum of $25MILLION(TWENTY FIVE
MILLION
UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY) in two trunks boxes which I have deposited
with a
Trust Company here in Togo and special arrangement has been made with the
currier
company who will freight the money to your country.
Meanwhile, I want to leave Togo entirely with this money for investment in
your
country because of a stable political situation there and mostly for the
future of
my children. I want you to please assist us to claim this fund from the
Trust
Company in any of their branches in Europe, after which the fund will be
deposited
into your account for investment in your country. You should also help us to
source for good investment opportunity so that we can invest wisely in your
country when the fund is finally confirmed in your account.
We have it in mind to reward you handsomely for your assistance as we have
resolved to give you 20% of the total sum for your help. But due to how I
am being
monitored by the Sierra Leonean Government Secret Agents, I will advice
you to
have the 
deal concluded with my son (IBRAHIM KOJO). Please contact my son on this
email:
ibrahimkojo@caramail.com , immediately you receive this letter to enable us
proceed in earnest towards retrieving the consignments and transferring
same into
your account.
Your private Fax and Phone is needed in this transaction for private
discussions. 
Note: There is no risk involved in this business. 
Remain Blessed,

168;http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,781616,00.htmlBritons stand tall, if slightly heavy, in EuropeJohn Carvel, social affairs editor
Wednesday August 28, 2002
The GuardianNot every European dimension has been harmonised in Brussels yet. According
to the Department for Trade and Industry, the average Briton stands head,
shoulders, girth and bottoms above their continental partners.
The figures come in a new edition of the department's handbook of
anthropometric and strength measurements, compiled by ergonomists at the
University of Nottingham to help manufacturers design products to fit
people's shape.
The volume provides 294 measurements ranging from the distance between the
inner corners of the eyes to the length of the leg between the crease below
the buttock to the crease at the back of the knee.
It has discovered that the average British man is 36 millimetres (1 inches)
taller than his French counterpart.
The mean height of UK citizens is 1,755.1mm (5ft 9in). Among European men
only the Dutch are taller, averaging 1,795mm and with a clear height
advantage over the US men's average of 1,760.4.
The average British woman is 1,620mm tall (just under 5ft 4in), compared
with 1,604mm for her French counterpart, 1,610mm for the Italians and
1,619mm for the Germans. Swedish women average 1,640mm, Dutch 1,650mm and
Americans 1,626.7mm
More disturbingly, British men and women are heavier than all the other
nationalities except the Americans, averaging 79.75 kilos for British men
and 66.7 for women.
The average British woman has a chest measurement of 1,007.8mm (39.7
inches), compared with 965mm for the Italians, 912.6mm for the Japanese and
806mm for Sri Lankans. American women also top this scale with an average of
1,047.2mm.
The average British woman's waist is 840.6mm (33 inches) - also second
largest behind the Americans. But her bottom at 873.7mm is considerably
smaller than the Italians at 916mm who beat the Americans into second place.
The average British male foot is 266.8mm long (10.5 inches), 6mm longer than
the French and Germans, 3mm more than the Italians and 1mm more than the
Swedes. But they are just beaten by the Americans at 267.8mm and massively
outstripped by the Dutch at 275mm.
However Dutch women have daintier feet than the British, averaging 240mm
compared with 241.1mm in the UK (9.5 inches). German women average 242mm,
compared with 245mm for the Swedes and 242.1mm for the Americans.
The DTI has a less than exhaustive record of ring finger lengths, but on the
available evidence the British man's finger at 78.7mm (3.1 inches) is 1.7mm
longer than his German counterpart, but 0.2mm shorter than the American
average.
The British woman's ring finger at 72.6mm is 0.4mm smaller than her German
counterpart and 0.3mm smaller than the American.
Beverley Norris, research fellow at Nottingham university's institute for
occupational ergonomics, said the figures were useful for product designers.
The department has recently completed a study of the pulling force needed to
open ring pull cans.------------------------ Yahoo! Groups Sponsor ---------------------~-->

176;Here's a weird and wacky problem:I'm currently out of the country with my trusty Evo N600c laptop. When I 
tried to use the serial port to talk to my mobile phone, Linux behaved 
pretty much as if the port was fried. Bizarre, I thought, because I'd 
used it successfully while in the office. The only difference was that I 
was trying the thing in the hotel. I entertained brief notions of having 
somehow fried the serial drivers, then rebooted the laptop to Windows 
and tried again. Worked perfectly. Back to Linux. Still not talking. 
Considered that it might be flaky power, so I ran the laptop on battery. 
Nope. Tried moving the laptop to a differnet part of the room where 
there might be less bogon flux. Still not working. Eventually I gave up 
and used the IrDA port instead - which is usually the serial connection 
of doom, grief, and teeth-grinding.This morning, in the office, the damn thing is working without a hitch.Anyone like to suggest what mystery technology is in use in the hotel 
that prevents serial ports from working under Linux?Cheers,
Waider.

186;syntax / semantics of gradable adjectives kennedy , christopher , projecting the adjective : the syntax and semantics of gradability and comparison , 0-8153 - 3349 - 8 , cloth , page 262 , $ 61 , garland publishing , outstanding dissertations in linguistics . this book investigates the core meaning and syntactic distribution of gradable adjectives : adjectives such as long , short , bright and dim , with respect to which objects can be ordered and compared . the central thesis is that gradable adjectives should be semantically characterized as measure functions : expressions that map objects onto abstract representations of measurement , or degrees . a second major claim is that degrees should be formalized as intervals on a scale , rather than discrete points , as standardly assumed . these proposals are supported by a number of empirical arguments involving the interpretation of comparative constructions in english , including scope phenomena , incommensurability , and the semantic behavior of antonymous adjectives . in addition , the semantic analysis is shown to support a straight forward compositional interpretation of syntactic representations in which adjectives project extended functional structure headed by degree morphology , thus bringing the analysis of the adjectival projection in line with current theoretical assumptions about the phrase structure and interpretation of the nominal and verbal projections . the proposals are formalized in terms of model-theoretic semantics and the principles and parameters syntactic framework . the text includes a comprehensive overview of previous approaches to the semantic analysis of gradable adjectives , as well as an introduction to some of the fundamental questions and puzzles involving the syntax and semantics of comparatives , and it presents new data which provide insight into the relation between comparatives and ellipsis . this book will be of interest to scholars in the areas of natural language semantics and the syntax-semantics interface , adjectives , comparative constructions , vagueness , antonymy , and english grammar in general . e - mail : info @ garland . com;Safe Email

193;Make sure you rebuild as root and you're in the directory that you
downloaded the file.  Also it might complain of a few dependencies but
you can get these at freshrpms.net, except for gcc3, which you can find
on your Red Hat cd, Red Hat ftp, or rpmfind.net.After you rebuild the source rpm it should install a binary rpm in
/usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386.  With all dependencies met, install mplayer
with 'rpm -ivh mplayer-20020106-fr1.rpm' and you should be good to go.One last thing, you will need the win32 codecs, I found them on google,
create a directory /usr/lib/win32 and place the codecs in there.Good Luck!LanceOn Thu, 2002-01-31 at 23:44, rob bains wrote:

the French is that they don't have a word for entrepreneur.
Origins:   Yet another French fried George W. Bush is dumb
story has been taken up by those who like their caricatures
drawn in stark, bold lines. According to scuttlebutt that
emerged in the British press in July 2002, President Bush,
Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair, and France's President
Jacques Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular,
the decline of the French economy. The problem with the
French, Bush afterwards confided in Blair, is that they don't
have a word for entrepreneur.The source was Shirley Williams, also known as the Baroness
Williams of Crosby, who claimed my good friend Tony Blair had
recently regaled her with this anecdote in Brighton.Lloyd Grove of The Washington Post was unable to reach Baroness
Williams to gain her confirmation of the tale, but he did
receive a call from Alastair Campbell, Blair's director of
communications and strategy. I can tell you that the prime
minister never heard George Bush say that, and he certainly
never told Shirley Williams that President Bush did say it,
Campbell told The Post. If she put this in a speech, it must
have been a joke.This is far from the first time Bush has been made the butt of
a jibe meant to showcase what some perceive as his less than
stellar intellectual abilities. Without straining our memories
too hard, we can come up with three other instances we've
chronicled on this site. In the summer of 2001, the joke of the
moment centered upon a supposed study that had resulted in the
ranking of Presidential IQs, with George W. Bush being pegged
as the Chief Executive who scraped the bottom of the
intelligence barrel. In December 2000 it was a fake Nostradamus
quatrain which pontificated that the village idiot would win
the 2000 Presidential election. And in the spring of 2002, it
was the story of Bush's waving at Stevie Wonder that set folks
to chortling up their sleeves.Stories that illustrate this widely believed intellectual
shortcoming will always waft after George W. Bush because they
seemingly confirm what many already hold as true about this
public figure, that he's not the brightest fellow that's ever
been. It is human nature to revel in yarns that the hearer at
some level agrees with, thus tales of this sort will always
fall upon appreciative ears.Barbara ears of corn MikkelsonLast updated:   29 July 2002http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork;Safe Email

214;Long time no chat!How have you been? If you've been like me, you've been trying
trying almost EVERYTHING to lose weight.Â  I know how you feel
- the special diets, miracle pills, and fancy exercise 
equipment never helped me lose the pounds I needed to lose
either.Â  It seemed like the harder I worked at it, the less
weight I lost - until I heard about 'Extreme Power Plus'.You're probably thinking to yourself, Oh geez, not another
miracle diet pill!Â  Like you, I was skeptical at first, but 
my sister said it helped her lose 23 pounds in just 2 weeks, 
so I told her I'd give it a try.Â  I mean, there was nothing 
to lose except a lot of weight!Â  Let me tell you, it was
the best decision I've ever made.  PERIOD.  Six months later,
as I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds
to 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet
at all.Â  Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it!I was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer
and received permission to resell it - at a HUGE discount.Â I feel
the need to help other people lose weight like I did, because it
does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.
I am giving you my personal pledge that 'Extreme Power Plus'
absolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU. 100 % Money-Back GUARANTEED!If you are frustrated with trying other products, without having 
any success, and just not getting the results you were promised,
then I recommend the only product that worked for me - 
'EXTREME POWER PLUS'!You're probably asking yourself, Ok, so how does this stuff
actually work?Extreme Power Plus contains Lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which 
is scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid 
weight loss. No hocus pocus in these pills - just RESULTS!!! Here is the bottom line ...I can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without
exercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day.Â  
Just try it for one month - there's pounds to lose and confidence 
to gain!Â  You will lose weight fast - GUARANTEED.Â  This is my
pledge to you.BONUS! Order NOW & get FREE SHIPPING on 3 bottles or more!Â  To order Extreme Power Plus on our secure server, just click

Forwarded by: Gary Williams A Mother had 3 virgin daughters. They were all getting married within a 
short time period. Because Mom was a bit worried about how their sex 
life would get started, she made them all promise to send a postcard 
from the honeymoon with a few words on how marital sex felt. The first girl sent a card from Hawaii two days after the wedding.  The 
card said nothing but Maxwell House.  Mom was puzzled at first, but 
then went to the kitchen and got out the Nescafe jar. It said: Good till 
the last drop. Mom blushed, but was pleased for her daughter. The second girl sent the card from Vermont a week after the wedding, 
and the card read: Benson & Hedges.  Mom now knew to go straight to 
her husband's cigarettes, and she read from the Benson & Hedges pack: 
Extra Long, King Size.  She was again slightly embarrassed but still 
happy for her daughter. The third girl left for her honeymoon in the Caribbean.  Mom waited for 
a week, nothing. Another week went by and still nothing.  Then after a 
whole month, a card finally arrived.  Written on it with shaky 
handwriting were the words: British Airways.  Mom took out her latest 
Harper's Bazaar magazine, flipped through the pages fearing the worst, 
and finally found the ad for the airline.  The ad said: Three times a 
day, seven days a week, both ways. Mom fainted.

By Denis MuellerAt the end of World War II, the United States was a rigidly 
segregated country but there were cracks beginning to show. 
In 1946, the Supreme Court ruled that ruled that segregated 
seating on interstate transportation was illegal. In 1947, 
the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) decided to challenge 
the racist system. The opposition was fierce and the riders 
were jailed often ending up on chain gangs.By 1961, the time was right to challenge America's Jim Crow 
laws and CORE proposed the Freedom Rides. CORE felt that 
they could count on the racists to oppose the rides thereby 
creating a crisis that would force the Federal Government to 
intervene to enforce the law. It would be dangerous and CORE 
members knew that they were risking their lives, but as CORE 
director James Farmer maintained they were ready.  When we 
began the ride I think all of us were prepared for as much 
violence as could be thrown at us. We were prepared for the 
possibility of death.

south they met no resistance but by the time they got to 
Alabama they were met by an angry band of terrorists who 
slashed the tires and burned the bus. In Birmingham it was 
worse. The FBI, through its informant James Rowe, were well 
aware that the Ku Klux Klan was waiting for them. So were 
the Birmingham police, led by Chief of police Bull Conner, 
and when they arrived they were severely beaten. Despite the warnings there were no police to protect them. 
Governor Patterson showed no mercy and blamed the riders. 
So the terrorist attacks went on. The Freedom Riders were 
determined to continue and were joined by a group of Nash-
ville students. They were met by hostility and were arrested 
and sent back to Tennessee. But the riders were fearless and 
immediately returned to Birmingham ready to continue the 
journey.------------------------------------------------------------    ---------> The Paranormal Insider Is Here! <---------ShagMail is PROUD to introduce our one and only paranormal

Freedom Riders left Birmingham on May 20th determined to 
continue. State officials had promised Attorney General Robert 
Kennedy they would be protected, but by the time they reached 
Montgomery there were no state police in sight. Seeing a mob, 
the riders feared for their lives, but Jim Zwerg, a white man, 
bravely walked out of the bus and was nearly beaten to death. 
He still suffers from the effects but his courage was un-
deniable. Others including Justice Department official John 
Seigenthaler were also beaten.The situation seemed to be out of control and federal inter-
vention finally saved the day with Governor Patterson declar-
ing martial law. Robert Kennedy called for a cooling off 
period but the riders refused. They would continue on. So 
they set off to Jackson, Mississippi but  Kennedy had made a 
deal with Mississippi officials. They were supposed to be 
protected, but upon arriving they were arrested. Kennedy had 
caved in. It was a cowardly decision by the Attorney General 
and the riders were sentenced for 60 days for exercising 
their constitutional rights. They never finished their trip 
but their courage showed the power of civil disobedience and 
in the end justice would prevail and terrorism would be 
defeated. It is another example of how people change things, 
not government officials.Sources: Eyes on the Prize------------------------------------------------------------

 Try installing the latest Perl (at least 5.6.1) port on Freebsd and make
sure you set the system to use perl from ports (i.e. in the
ports/lang/perl5/files directory run ./use.perl port. Reinstall the relevant
perl modules needed by razor and try again.Sven-------------------------------------------------------

272;Uh, WWII Enigma was cracked at Bletchly Park, based on the work of some 
Poles, who had been trying to figure out when they would be invaded.   
Entirely mechanical!   Definitely not optical at all.    Enigma was 
originally broken based on bad use practice.  If it had been employed more 
sensibly it would have been a lot harder.See The Code Book by Singh, Doubleday, 1999.     Or, for that matter, 
Cryptonomicon by Stephenson, which is a fictionalization of the Enigma 
cracking story, and pretty accurate.I eventually get born as a side-effect of the Battle of Britain, you 
see....Computing with interference patterns, etc, makes perfect sense, but Enigma 
was cracked by building mechanical systems that were essentially Enigma 
machines and brute-forcing.Eirikur

I wouldn't say that the societies of humans here before European occupancy
was 'lifted' by free xyz. Perhaps 'replaced' or 'sunk' or some other
description, but not 'lifted'. Also, the lifestyle of the remnants of those
societies is on average only marginally above poverty even today.

278;granada workshop adapting lexical and corpus resources to sublanguages and applications a workshop to be held at the first international conference on language resources and evaluation granada , spain , 26 may 1998 the workshop will provide a forum for those researchers involved in the development of methods to integrate corpora and mrds , with the aim of adding adaptive capabilities to existing linguistic resources . organisers : roberto basili ( university of roma  tor vergata  ) , roberta catizone ( university of sheffield ) , maria teresa pazienza ( university of roma  tor vergata  ) , paola velardi ( university of roma  la sapienza ) , yorick wilks ( university of sheffield ) workshop scope and aims lexicons , i . e . , those components of a nlp system that contain  computable  information about words , cannot be considered as static objects . words may behave very differently in different domains , and there are language phenomena that do not generalize across sublanguages . lexicons are a snapshot of a given stage of development of a language , normally provided without support for adaptation changes , whether caused by language creativity and development or the shift to such a previously unencountered domain . the divergence of corpus usages from lexical norms has been studied computationally at least since the late sixties , but only recently has the availability of large on-line corpora made it possible to establish methods to cope systematically with this problem . an emerging branch of research is now involved in studies and experiments on corpus-driven linguistics , with the aim of complementing and extending earlier work on lexicon acquisition based on machine readable dictionaries ( mrd ) : data are extracted from texts , as embodiments of language in use , so as to capture lexical regularities and to code them into operational forms . the purpose of this workshop will be to provide an updated snapshot of current work in the area , and promote discussion of how to make progress . central topics will be ( though this list is in no way exclusive ) : * corpus-driven tuning of mrds to optimize domain-specific inferences , * terminology and jargon acquisition , * sense extensions , * acquisition of preference or subcategorization information from corpora * taxonomy adaptation , * statistical weighting of senses etc . to domains * use of mrds to provide explanations of linguistic phenomena in corpora * what is the scope of  lexical tuning  * the evaluation of lexical tuning as a separate task , or as part of a more generic task program committee yorick wilks university of sheffield roberta catizone university of sheffield paola velardi university of roma  la sapienza  maria teresa pazienza university of roma  tor vergata  roberto basili university of roma  tor vergata  bran boguraev brandeis university sergei nirenburg new mexico state university james pustejowsky brandeis university ralph grishman new york university christiane fellbaum princeton university paper submission formatting guidelines : papers should not exceed 4000 words or 10 pages . hard copies : three hard copies should be sent to : paola velardi dipartimento di scienza dell ' informazione via salaria 113 00198 roma italy electronic submission : electronic submission will be allowed in poscript or word per mac or rtf . an ftp site will be available on demand . authors should send an info email to paola velardi ( velardi @ dsi . uniroma1 . it ) even if they submit in paper form . an electronic submission should be accompanied by a plain ascii text . # name : name of first author # title : title of the paper # pages : number of pages # files : name of file ( if also submitted electronically ) # note : anything you 'd like to add # keys : keywords # email : email of the first author # abstr : abstract of the paper # . . . . . . important dates paper submission deadline ( hard copy / electronic ) february 20 paper notification march 20 camera - ready papers due april 15 l&ct workshop may 26 conference information general information about the conference is at : < http : / / www . icp . inpg . fr / elra / conflre . html > specific queries about the conference should be directed to : lrec secretariat facultad de traduccion e interpretacion dpto . de traduccion e interpretacion c / puentezuelas , 55 18002 granada , spain tel : + 34 58 24 41 00 - fax : + 34 58 24 41 04 reli98 @ goliat . ugr . es;Safe Email

directly compared, because I changed the methodology.  In 2.40 the scores
were evolved on the entire corpus, then evaluated using that corpus, ie.
there was no blind testing, and the scores could overfit and still
provide good statistics.In 2.42, they're evaluated blind, on a totally unseen set of messages,
so those figures would be a lot more accurate for real-world use.--j.;Safe Email

    your shower curtains and $2,200 for a wastebasket, it's a Good Thing to do 
    so, practically essential. Then they explain how:     Sometimes the wastebasket is exposed, said Joel Joves, a designer with 
    offices in Rancho Santa Fe and Beverly Hills. If you have a fabulous study

329;amta workshop on embedded mt systems - cfp workshop announcement - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - workshop on embedded mt systems call for papers design , construction , and evaluation of systems with an mt component wednesday , october 28 , 1998 ( preceding the amta 98 conference ) sheraton bucks county hotel , langhorne , pennsylvania introduction as the strengths and weaknesses of machine translation ( mt ) engines have become better understood and accepted , there has been a marked increase in the development of computer systems with anembedded mt component . one consequence of this shift to  embedded mt  is that researchers , developers , as well as users have begun pushing the limits on the input that such systems will accept for translation . in so doing , a new class of problems has surfaced : any input - - - whether it appears in physical form on paper , in electronic form on-line , or mixed in with another modality such as graphics or video - - - will bring with it some unknown mix of noisy natural language data as well as non-linguistic data . how are systems with an mt component to be designed and evaluated given the challenge this input brings ? the objective of this workshop is to examine and evaluate techniques for adjusting this  linguistic impedance mismatch  between the real-world input and the natural language input expected by various mt engines . thus the workshop will focus on computational approaches to preprocessing system input for mt engines andon statistical methods for evaluating systems with an embedded mt component . linguistic preprocessing in image data for researchers working with image data , there is currently underway an effort to augment ocr ( optical character recognition ) engines with linguistic data as they recognize and convert bitmap data into characters - - - similar to what has already been done in speech recognition with linguistic data in hmms ( hidden markov models ) . other ocr researchers have also experimented with image-level early topic detection using word-shape recognition . in principle , this could provide a first-step filtering of documents into a more homogeneous mt input set , a desirable goal for mt evaluation . thus we expect that individuals working with or intending to incorporate ocr into their computer systems will be interested in this new area . linguistic preprocessing in online data for those working with online input , even though the characters are already present , there often still remains the task of preprocessing meaningful , symbolic character strings that are not a part of the text to be translated . for some systems , the rules for identifying and encapsulating or removing such strings may need to be hand-crafted over time as mt engine limitations surface . for others , a combination of hand-crafted rules and statistically trained nl models has worked . many have observed that the html annotations , alphanumeric items , spreadsheet and word processing codes are harder to weed out than originally expected . research efforts with the low-density and less-commonly taught languages , as well as more common ones , encounter a substantial problem with variation in spelling conventions and transcription preferences . for those natural languages that are primarily spoken and not written , for example , this is frequently the case . researchers working on this class of problem have built variants on spell checkers ( sc ) , components that standardize words to one orthography ( spelling convention ) before submitting it to an mt engine . an idea that has arisen for this component is to build in an option to adjust the level of sc correction - - - as would be relevant when input after ocr nonetheless varies from very noisy to relatively clean . evaluation of embedded mt systems among those working on statistical methods for evaluating systems with an embedded mt component , we have seen two distinct trends . one group of statisticians has begun looking for appropriate models from outside the world of mt evaluation , examining the efforts by others to take distinct metrics for components and combine them for an overall system-level metric using fuzzy mathematics . another group of researchers is looking instead at developing a one-dimensional scale for ranking mt engines along a continuum defined by system-level function . that approach , for example , might rank one engine as good enough for filtering documents , while another engine deemed more linguistically robust would be ranked higher because it could generate a good enough initial translation for subsequent post-editing . we welcome other functional evaluations of mt components and computer systems with embedded mt components as well . submissions submitters are invited to send in a short paper , not more than 5 pages , addressing one or more of the three areas discussed above . papers should define the problem in an embedded mt system that is the focus of the work , describe the embedded mt system design ( a simple sketch ) with sample input data where relevant , and present their approach to the problem . work at various stages of completion is acceptable , we expect the current status of the work to be made clear . submission of end-to - end output of an embedded mt system is especially encouraged . the papers will be collected and distributed to participants of theworkshop . ideally , the result of the workshop will be a clearer delineation of : ( 1 ) the range of linguistic preprocessing problems ( 2 ) the range of designs in embedded mt systems ( 3 ) how these problems aretreated in different embedded mt systems and ( 4 ) the metrics that are being used to evaluate these systems and their components . dates notice of interest in participation : july 10 , 1998 ( to voss @ arl . mil ) please identify which of the three areas you intend to address : preprocessing in image data , preprocessing in online data , evaluation of embedded mt systems . position paper submission : august 10 , 1998 notifications : september 10 , 1998 final copies of papers : october 10 , 1998 workshop : october 28 , 1998 submissions may be in printed or electronic form . submissions should be sent to : clare voss army research laboratory amsrl-is -

    I hate to ask...I've heard it mentioned several times here, but I couldn't find a digest, and the hits I found on Google turned up missing pages.  :(    I thought I was reporting spams all this time...the last month or so...but I wasn't.  I had a pathing problem going on, and a log-pathing problem, too, but hadn't noticed it yet.  Now, the system seems to be working, other than this message in the logs:    nextserver: Could not get valid info from Discovery Servers    What's the fix for this again?  Is it a server outtage, or something else?    I'm using the 2.03 sdk, and the new 2.14 agent...------------------------------------------------------------------------

341;basic word order this is a somewhat delayed reaction to frederick newmeyer 's posting on basic word order . i was prepared to let someone else comment on the underlying logic of newmeyer 's message . this did not happen , however , so here comes . newmeyer observes that data from a given language seldom exhibits an unambiguous ' basic word order ' , and there seem to be no generally agreed-upon criteria to resolve this ambiguity . he further notes that this fact reveals a weakness in functionalist linguistics ( or , in more polite terms , ' presents a challenge to it ' ) . he adds , on two occasions , that generative linguistics is increasingly coming to share the same weakness . by ` increasingly ' he must mean the fact that some applications of the principles-and - parameters approach are taking both language-particular and cross-linguistic data into account more seriously than used to be the case . before these developments , generative linguistics decreed that every ( configurational ) language has some sort of basic word order , as specified by the phrase structure ( or x - bar ) component of its grammar . newmeyer seems to suggest that this type of basic word order did not share the weakness that is ' increasingly ' becoming a characteristic of generative linguistics . the difference between earlier generative linguistics and current generative linguistics , and between their respective conceptions of basic word order , resides in the fact that the former did not , whereas the latter does , pay systematic attention to ( cross - ) linguistic data . newmeyer 's formulation then seems to suggest that not paying attention to ( cross - ) linguistic data is a strength of the theory . esa itkonen;Safe Email

Marc -- Since perl itself is a scripting language, and allows code to be eval'ed,
I can't see why we need to go the whole hog and implement another
turing-complete scripting language in perl.Let's go back to *why* this would be useful.  As far as I can see, you're
proposing this to deal with multi-match rules.  There's already a tracker
in the bug DB for these, with a proposed implementation.  http://www.hughes-family.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=47I think this might have stalled due to shortcomings in the existnig
proposal, so I've just added my own thoughts on how to implement them. ,)
Comments on the proposed system would be welcome folks.... reply to the
bug db.--j.--

363;capital book to further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing enron america ' s velocity of capital and associated return on invested capital , we have decided to create a capital book . the capital book will have no profit target associated with it and will be managed by joe deffner . the purpose of creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within enron americas , with any form of capital requirement , are structured correctly and are allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge . the previous numbers used in the business plans at the beginning of this year will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets . therefore , on any assets currently held within each business area , the capital charge will remain at 15 % . internal ownership of these assets will be maintained by the originating business unit subject to the internal ownership policy outlined below . the cost of capital associated with all transactions in enron americas will be set by joe . this process is separate and apart from the current rac process for transactions which will continue unchanged . capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge at the previously established rate of 15 % . transactions which are structured off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15 % across the board charge . transactions which are structured off balance sheet , but on credit will be priced based upon the financial impact on enron america ' s overall credit capacity . on transactions that deploy capital through the trading books , the capital book will take a finance reserve on each transaction , similar to the way the credit group takes a credit reserve . this finance reserve will be used specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction . as noted above , the capital book will have no budget and will essentially charge out to the origination and trading groups at actual cost . by sending market - based capital pricing signals internally , enron america ' s sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the organization . questions regarding the capital book can be addressed to : joe deffner 853 - 7117 alan quaintance 345 - 7731;Safe Email

367;sum : sign-singing a few weeks ago i posted the following query : ) here in taiwan there is a tv program in which people compete ) to see who is the best singer . there are different categories ) for different types of songs / languages , etc . , and one category ) is for  sign singing  . a tape of a song is played , and a signer ) signs along with the words of the song ( all those i ' ve seen ) compete were not deaf ) . i was wondering if this is common in ) other countries , and if so , what the criteria are for judging ) who is  the best  , and also if it is done at all by people ) who are deaf . thanks . i received a number of interesting responses : ) from jane edwards ( edwards @ cogsci . berkeley . edu ) : ) thought not pertaining to contests or even singing , for that matter , ) i saw something on pbs a couple months back which i wanted to mention . ) they showed a  music appreciation  class taught to totally deaf high school ) kids , in which they each were wearing pad on the back , which converts the ) acoustic output into pressure stimulation . the students were dancing to ) the music , and commenting on different types of music . they were n't ) singing / signing to it , but perhaps they could ? ) from jakob dempsey ( jakob @ u . washington . edu ) : ) one of the largest , most popular choruses in seattle regularly ) has a sign-language  interpreter  on stage during performances , the ) particular one who has been doing it for a long time is not deaf , he seems ) to also appeal a lot to the general audience with his expressive , exaggerated ) style . ) from midori yonezawa ( yonezawa @ student . msu . edu ) : ) i believe that there is a sign singing contest because music can be shared ) by everybody and it is natural to want to show different expressions each ) other . ) i learned japanese sign language in japan ( a little bit ) , and sometimes i ) practiced sign singing , too . i went to concerts where the singers were ) all professional  shanson  singers (  shanson  is french loan into japanese ) . ) they have a concert every year for those who are handicapped , not only ) for deaf people . some singers sang with sign language at the same time as ) they sang vocally , and when the singers did n't do so there was an interpreter ) of sign language on the stage . i noticed and surprised that the ways of ) expressing by sing language are very different from each other and from ) occasions , e . g . fast / slow , soft / pressing , emotional / calm , etc , etc . . ) i also remember a tv program ( on nhk ) about equipment to help those who have ) difficulty in hearing . a technical group developed the equipment so that ) they can hear music . ) from peggy swartzel lott ( pslott @ utxvms . cc . utexas . edu ) : ) when i was a sign language interpreter and interpreter coordinator in ) san diego , california , there was quite a to-do a few years back over ) the issue of song sign . i first remember encountering song sign in ) the early to mid 70 's when a few groups of deaf performers ( i . e . ) musign ) toured the country performing popular songs in sign along ) with recorded sound tracks . later a pair of excellent performers , ) sharon neumann solow and gary sanderson , both individuals who were ) raised with deaf parents and fluent in asl , toured and performed ) songs in sign . ) ) the controversy in san diego centered on a local  annual song sign ) competition  hosted by the area 's rid branch , sanscrid . the ) competition was open to the public and was established both for ) a general  deaf awareness  activity and to raise funds for various ) purposes . prizes were given out for best individual song , best ) group , etc . the performance of the competition was quite popular ) and seemed to be growing in attendance and participation each year . ) ) a group of deaf people contested the competition on various grounds . ) the points i remember best about their objection ( because i ) personally found these issues most compelling ) were that the ) actual performances were offensive to some native signers because ) of the way putting sign to music distorted the linguistic and ) aesthetic dynamics of asl . that is , in order to make a signed ) narrative conform to the lyrics of a song , to translate it ) simultaneously with the recorded music , many grammatical patterns ) in normal signing had to be altered . often the performance bore ) little resemblance to normal signing . ) ) there was great debate for a while in the community over this issue . ) certain deaf people and many hearing interpreters and sign ) students defended the practice of song sign . some insisted that ) they be allowed to exercise their own artistic talents in playing ) with signing in this way . others felt that song sign provided an ) important bridge that enabled many uninformed hearing people to ) become aware of and appreciate the beauty of signing . the ) community was divided over the issue and eventuall y the whole ) thing was dropped . in the meantime , however , certain concerns ) of deaf people were brought to the surface and continued to be a ) source of discussion : issues about who has the right to make poetic ) use of signing and what sorts of alterations in signing style are ) acceptable to native users and which are not . i found the whole ) debate quite interesting and was genuinely convinced by the ) argument of the deaf people who were opposed to the practice . ) from richard arnold ( richard . arnold @ vuw . ac . nz ) : ) here in new zealand we have an annual new zealand sign langauge story - telling ) competition . mostly the competitors are deaf , but some codas also partipate as ) well . i have yet to see any hearing compete , however i know of some deaf for ) whom nz sign language is a second language learnt later in their adult life ) also participate . ) ) the winners are usually those who are quite fluent in nzsl . the criteria for ) judging is ( to my understanding ) as follows : ) ) - is the signing clear to the audience ? ) - does the signer get the audiences attention ? ) - is the story well structured ? ) - is the story within the time limits set ( usually 3 minutes ) ? ) - does the signer keep to the rules ? ) this usually consists of - no dirty jokes . ) - no overzealous religious contexts . ) ) the competitior must give a title to his / her story and state its type , ( ie true ) story , joke story , sad story , not true story etc . . . ) ) ) if the story exceeds the time limit a point is deducted . however the signer is ) not interrupted if he / she exceeds the limit but is allowed to complete the ) story ( unless it really is too long ! ! ! ) . ) ) sometimes , at the end the winner ( if he / she is popular with the audience is ) asked to repeat it or give another story ) . ) ) . . . sign-singing is not too common among the deaf community far as i am ) aware . it is mostly done in religious situations . i think it is n't a strong ) component of deaf culture . however story-telling is a strong part of deaf ) culture and especially of making jokes and light-hearted teasing . anyway thats ) my deaf experience here in new zealand . ) from karina bingham ( karina @ uhunix . uhcc . hawaii . edu ) : ) there is an african - american a cappella group called  sweet honey in the ) rock  who have a full-time signer in the group . she performs with them and ) signs her interpretations of the songs . they recently published a book ) for their 25th anniversary : ) ) reagon , bernice johnson . the long journey home . 1994 . ) ) in which the signer discusses her experiences in the deaf community and ) a deaf church ( where the congregation sang in sign ) . her parents were both ) deaf , she is not . ) from marina mcintire ( mmcintir @ lynx . dac . neu . edu ) : ) you have inadvertently touched upon a very tender issue in the deaf ) community here in the us . first , let me say that only in the us have i ) seen this phenomenon . brits ( both deaf and hearing who work with them ) ) are confounded and amused by it . in the us , it used to be quite the ) thing to translate songs and develop routines to go with them , produce ) recitals and concerts , and the like . it arose , most likely , out of a ) strong church-related tradition of  helpers  for deaf people . ) ) in the last ten to fifteen years , however , deaf people have begun their ) own liberation . song - signing has been a casualty , by and large . it is ) viewed as representing one aspect of a pathological or clinical view of ) deafness , i . e . , that the worst  loss  resulting from deafness is music . ) this is , of course , far from the truth . and for culturally deaf people , ) music is a peculiarity belonging to the mainstream hearing world and of ) no consequence in their lives whatsoever . so * that * motive ( helping ) d / deaf people appreciate what they ' re missing ) is not acceptable . ) ) another complaint is that , by and large , translations are more ) influenced by the rhythm of the music than by any sense it might make in ) asl , presenting d / deaf audiences with nonsensical or distorted versions ) of signs and signed syntax . this arises partly , of course , out of the ) difficulty of translating any poetry into any language . ) ) worst of all , and perhaps most puzzling to d / deaf people , is the ) insistence of most song-signers on including things like  tra la la  or ) humming . there is * nothing * that could make less sense to a d / deaf ) audience ! ) ) i will say that i have seen some wonderful song-sign translations done , ) including some with rather elegant dance routines . sometimes these have ) been done by d / deaf people and sometimes by hearing folks . by and large , ) however , this practice is no longer an acceptable pasttime in our ) community . exceptions are made , ironically , for interpreters who work in ) theater . musical productions , because of their general inclusion of ) dance ( a more interesting visual event ) and costume / props / etc . . . are ) quite popular and well-attended ( comparatively speaking ) by d / deaf ) theatre-goers . many thanks to all those who replied . randy lapolla institute of history and philology academia sinica;Safe Email

370;Not fortean, but a moment in time all the same...http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/2220972.stm
Betamax video recorders are finally being phased out almost 20 years after
losing the battle for dominance of the home video market to VHS. 
Betamax's manufacturer, Sony, has announced that it will make only 2,000
more machines for the Japanese market. They have not been on sale in the rest of the world since 1998.  
VHS became the dominant format by the mid-1980s
 
Betamax was launched in 1975, and won many fans who said it was better
quality than its VHS rival. Some 2.3 million Betamax machines were sold worldwide in its peak year,
1984, but it soon went downhill as VHS became the format of choice for the
film rental industry and in homes. Just 2,800 machines were sold in the 12 months to March 2002. With digital machines and other new recording formats taking hold in the
market, demand has continued to decline and it has become difficult to
secure parts, Sony said in a statement. Sony said it would continue to offer repairs and manufacture tapes for the
format. The professional Betamax format, Betacam, is still widely used in the
television and film industries and will be unaffected. But the recent rise of DVDs seems to have put the final nail in the coffin
for Betamax home players. In the 1980s, many video rental chains preferred the VHS format. Betamax lovers became so passionate about the format in the face of
competition from VHS that they set up the Betaphile Club in 1988. The picture and sound quality of Beta was superior to VHS, Betaphiles say,
although VHS tapes had a longer duration. A total of 18 million Betamax machines were sold around the world, but no
new ones will be made after the end of 2002. Sony is now planning to focus its efforts on new digital technologies.

Here is what our customers are saying about the Temple â€œ3â€ Ragga Dagga (TM) phenomenon:â€œTo whom it may concern,I was skeptical when I first read your ad.  I grew up in the 70â€™s & 80â€™s.  I was a hard core (alternative smoker) then.  So I knew my stuff.  But drug tests stopped that!  Now I am disabled from a degenerative muscle, ligament, and tendon disease.  I was smoking (an illegal product) for the pain and nausea.  Now I have something just as good, Temple 3, but cheaper, and it is legal!  I also have a lot of trouble sleeping, but the Capillaris Herba made into tea works and smells great!  Your products that I tried so far, are as good or better than your ads say!  That is hard to find nowadays in a company.  Who ever put this stuff together is a botanical genius.  I will be a customer for life!  Also, I talked with a lady on the phone when I was ordering, and asked her to find out if I could get my products and samples to hand out for free.  And just send the customers to you.  Or get a discount on products that I could sell retail to people.  I would prefer the earlier one becau!
se, I can just talk about your products, I am a great salesman (about 10 years experience), I could hand out flyers, give out little 1 gram pieces as samplers with your business card enclosed, etc.. I am going to be unable to work a regular job for a while, maybe indefinitely?  This deal would give me my own products and samples for free?  You would get free advertising, word of mouth, samples into peoples hands to try, someone that is very good with computers, someone who studied about mail order, Internet, cold calling, small business, good with people, etc..  I would like to be doing something, even if I would get on Social Security Disability.  It is very disheartening not being able to work to support my 2 teenage boys, or do a lot of the things I used to do!  At least I would be able to do something worthwhile.  And great products makes it real easy to sell.  Let me know what you think?Sincerely,RJâ€Location: Midwest, U.S.A.â€œThank you so much for the Ragga.  It is everything you guys claim, and then some!  I was a bit skeptical when I read your description of its effects, but there is literally no exaggeration in your advertisements.  How nice that this is non-prohibited!  It tastes great and feels great too!  I am so glad I took a chance and ordered.  Blessings to all of you.â€-- Frankie R.Location: West Coast, USAâ€œIâ€™m a man of my 40â€™s and I really know my stuff.  I donâ€™t drink or do illegal drugs anymore and have found a much more spiritual path.  I used to have to take Valium in the past.  Not anymore with the Temple â€œ3â€.  It really amazes me how this stuff tastes like the Lebanese and blonde stuff I used to smoke in the 70â€™s.  I am very satisfied with all of your products.  I like them a lot and will be a customer for life for sure.  Whoever makes this stuff is an ARTIST at it.  Who would have thought?!â€  -- A.J.Location: United Kingdom

392;re : summary : ' no ' and ' man ' thanks for all the responses . it was really something to get the number and quality of ideas . 1 . ' no ' my initial query was : south african english use of ' no ' - does this occur in contexts such as : a . how are you ? b . no , i ' m fine . in other english varieties / other languages ? confronted with such examples , vistors to the country often comment that in sa english , ' no ' means ' yes ' . this , of course , is not true . ' no ' would be the response to the question ' do you have the time ? ' if the speaker did n't have the time . * generally : a couple of people commented that ' no ' definitely does not mean ' yes ' in these contexts . what it does is rather to negate the possibility of a negative belief concerning the answer to the question . in the example above , for instance , b . is negating a . 's possible belief that b . is not well . why south africans hold that the possibility of such negative beliefs is so strong they have to be denied remains to be seen . * ' no ' in other varieties of english the use of ' no ' in the types of examples cited anyway is not recorded according to the responses in : - australian english - american english - english english it is recorded in : - nigerian and ghanaian english there do appear to be related ( but not identical ) discourse uses of ' no ' and similar particles in other varieties of english . few english responses actually dealt with this usage at all . by far the majority were on ' man ' * ' no ' in other languages ' no ' does seem to be used in a variety of other languages in the same way as in sa english . similar uses are recorded in : - the scandinavian languages - german ( 'd och ' - similar but not identical ) - cameroon french - bangkok thai ( ' plaw ' - lit . ' empty ' ) - spanish ? it also occurs , incidentally , in afrikaans . 2 . ' man ' my question here related to the use of ' man ' to express a negative emotional involvement of the speaker of some sort - irritation , impatience or annoyance . examples given were : man it 's hot today hurry up mom , man man , i can't this right * english a huge response that showed that ' man ' is used similarly in : - american english ( both ' black ' and ' white ' ) - scottish english - tyneside english ( in north east of england ) - jamaican english - welsh english - an ' americanism ' found in other varieties of english . the american english usage at least does not necessary carry negative sentiment and is ' a more general tag . . . over which any kind of emotional intonation can be laid ' . example b . above , an example which typifies sa usage , was found to be odd ( ' wierd ' ) by american respondants . the reason for this is that ' man ' although an interjection still appears to ' have the flavour of a term of address so that ' mom , man ' sounds like two forms of direct address in a row ' . it seems , then , that ' man ' in sae does not bare the feature ' term of address ' at all in such contexts . the only instance in which similar usages were given was in tyneside english . ( ' shut up man geoff ' ' those kegs are too tight man mary ' . here though , the actual term of address occurs finally as opposed to the use of ' man ' finally in sae . this needs to be explored further , but of further interest : - there is a distinctly ' american ' use of ' man ' in sae that is not like the south african use of man ( ' cool man ' type of utterances ) . - other sa examples of man : - daddy , man ! ( 5 year old daughter after i stood on her toe ) - man , david , i do n't mean that ( wife and self in ' altercation ' ) - no man , that 's not right . - man ! this bloody computer is giving problems . - saenglish ' man ' alternates between shwa and full vowel in all contexts . ( in sae shwa occurs as a vowel in stressed contexts - 's it ' can have shwa for eg ) : related usage in currant american english is the use of 'd ude ' . * other languages related uses of ' man ' include : - dutch - swedish ( ' boy ' is used in a similar way ) - norwegian - ? german use of ' etwa ' may have similar function - german ( ' usually to indicate weariness ' ) - spanish - ? lhasa tibetan ( ' mi ' - ' person ' ) interestingly in dutch the 'd ouble address form [ as in ' hurry up mom , man ' ] is impossible ( just  schiet op , man  must do ) . ' some interesting stuff came out as you can see . just for your interest , on further sa english item : - ' sorry ' for ' i beg your pardon ' e . g . a drops something without knowing . b picks it up and calls out to a ' sorry , you dropped something ' anyway thanks to : helen adamson geoffrey sampson elin haf gruffyd jones celso alvarez caccamo mai kuha mark donohue marek przezdziecki scott delancey mats eeg-olofsson dom watt hilde hasselgard nicole nelson jane a . edwards sren harder charlie rowe nobue mori adiego lajara bruce connell krisadawan hongladarom frank bramlett deborah milam berkley douglas s oliver larry trask kristine hasund paul boersma m . lynne roecklein judy l . delin benji wald stephen p . spackman john verhaar randall major + the person who wished to be anonymous for the references .;Safe Email

395;DEAR SIR/MADAMRE: BUSINESS ASSISTANCEI have decided to contact your assistance in relation to the following business proposal, having obtained your contact through the commercial attach of your country's embassy in South Africa. This recommendation is based on the information that you will not betray the trust and confidence to be reposed in you. I am Romila Kabila the second son of the assassinated former President Of Democratic Republic Of Congo (D.C) Late Laurent Desire Kabila who on Tuesday 16 January   during the four years rule of my father I was his confidential/private security and base on my position of relationship of father and son. I was able to be in change of the president's personal security vault and some of his savings.Now following the death of my father, the immediate family of the late President Kabila has met and concluded that some savings and security vault of the former President should be moved out of the troubled Democratic Republic of Congo with immediate president of Democratic republic of Congo by the late Kabila has been appointed president of democratic republic of Congo by the late kabila's national executive council and the country top military brass, and properties worth millions of US$ to relocate the late president kabila's assets and properties with millions of dollars  to over sea country where there is good political climate. We have concluded arrangement to move/transfer the sum US$42M to a finance and security company in London through a Diplomatic courier services. The family through a diplomatic contact during my father's regime, conclude an arrangement to lodge/deposit the above sums with the GLOBAL DIPLOMATIC AND SECURITY SERVICES in LONDON - U.K!
. And it is on this, that I am soliciting for your assistance to help us receive this amount from this security company once it arrives London upon your acceptance to assist in this project as we the family member can not do it on our own because of the code of conduct, which was introduced by my late father to checkmate excess embezzlement/siphoning of the Government/public funds overseas country as the case had be during the Late President Mobutu Sese Seko. So one cannot make law and destroy the same law. Therefore if you can render your assistance, please indicate your interest to me through my email romkabila@presidency.com, you should then urgently arrange to travel to London and clear the (consignments) funds upon it arrival and subsequent payment of the US$42M into your bank account. As soon as we hear from you, we then send a representative to be with you in London to represent our interest. Based on your anticipated efforts and contri!
bution the family has resolved to give you 20% commission and the remaining 80% will be reclaimed by the family. It will be my pleasure to be able to co-operate with you on terms that you may wish for the successful completion of this project. Thanks and remain blessed.Best Regards,
ROMILA KABILA

pretty much every version of gcc (2.95, 2.96, 3.0, 3.1, and the 
forthcoming 3.2) breaks C++ binary compatibility in some way or other.Paul.

Date: Not suppliedAfter discovering an open wireless net available from his sofa, Steven 
Hackers Levy interviewed lawmen, academics and WiFi activists about the 
legality and ethics of using open wireless access points.     I downloaded my mail and checked media news on the Web. When I confessed 
    this to FBI agent Bill Shore, he spared the handcuffs. The FBI wouldn't 
    waste resources on that, he sniffed. Now I know that if it did, it would 
    be hard to argue that I broke a law. What's more, I certainly didn't feel 
    illegal. Becauseï¿½and this is the point of all that war-driving and 
    -chalking and node-stumblingï¿½when you get used to wireless, the experience 
    feels more and more like a God-given right. One day we may breathe 
    bandwidth like oxygenï¿½and arguing its illegality will be unthinkable.  Link[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Steven[3]!_)[1] http://www.msnbc.com/news/816606.asp

Unlike, for example, India or Asia.There is a hot dispute about the original size of the indigenous population, but the evidence for a high density in the Mexican area is sound. It was up here in the North or in the Amazon where I'm a little more suspicious of very high upward revisions.At least that was my take.I have never heard anyone seriously argue that European diseases were not a significant factor, or that there were not in fact a lot of Aztec people prior to Cortez.

( this is a key difference between this agreement and the socal mou . ) the other tenets of the deal would only have to be approved by the puc . in other words , sempra claims that it will be able to eliminate sdg & e ' s undercollect just by dealing with the puc rather than the legislature . sources suggest that this may be in reaction to the failure of the socal mou to move in the legislature . sources also indicate that the earlier trans - elect offer to purchase sdg & e lines for ( $ 1 . 8 b ) considerably less than the states bid only makes the california legislature more leery of approving the socal mou . mou attached below . davis kindles new fire over dwr contracts friday ' s release of the cadwr power contracts motioned republicans to begin a new wave of complaints against the governor remarking that the contract information was lacking and data that the public has a right to know had been blacked out . assembly member dave cox ( minority leader ) stated that the most troubling items were the clauses that exempt generators from having to pay windfall profit taxes or environmental penalties , and instead these would be paid by taxpayers . backlash from the republicans has been increasing as a new wave of california television commercials peg davis as the root of california ' s energy woes . ge out west sources report that there are 3 or 4 ge generator sets ( peaker plants ) on the market now for $ 14 - $ 15 m . this is because the people who bought these units do not want to go forward and get into the california market because it is  too arbitrary .  sources report that the sellers of these generator sets made this decision beginning approximately a week ago . additionally , sources believe that ge may move to cost - plus - based pricing for sellers of power in order to provide stable financing for generators over the long term , though this would mean less profits than in the past . pg & e executives profit even in bankruptcy as reported on 6 - 14 , sources continue to believe that socal executives are closely following the events unfolding in the pg & e bankruptcy case , as mentioned in last thursday ' s report  judge montali approved large bonuses for pg & e senior management after pg & e ' s filing made bryson and other members of his team  reconsider  the merits of bankruptcy .  today ' s news reports of judge montali ' s order providing pg & e executive with $ 17 . 5 m in bonuses just reiterates the point to bryson that pg & e executives remain well - paid even in bankruptcy thus suggesting socal could do equally well in the event of a filing . sources suggest that socal ' s current cash position weighs less heavily in determining a bankruptcy filing than the prospect of asset seizures / liens ( however , sources continue to make inquiries as to socal ' s cash flow situation . );Safe Email

426;re : 5 . 1225 linguistics and imperialism with regard to hoberman 's comment , it would not make sense to say that linguistics is inherently imperialistic in nature , any more than it would for any other science , since linguistics is multi-faceted and has many purposes , some now well established and others continually evolving , e . g . ,  forensic  applications of linguistics etc . since language is universal , applications for linguistics are universal . in my earlier comments i dwelt on diversity among languages because that 's where the connection between linguistics ( mainly as an aid to learning and teaching languages ) and multilingual empires ( =  imperialism  ) is easiest to see . however , i also noted that there are people who are interested in language and linguistic diversity for its own sake . i suspect that this is universal . although it may be reflected differently in different cultures . maybe the universality of interest in language and linguistic diversity is reflected in myths about the origin of such diversity , or other kinds of  pre-linguistic  explanations . among cultures which seem particularly ethnocentric to me , classic athenian culture perhaps was less encouraging to interest in other languages than most cultures ( with the us perhaps close behind but also with a complex fear and insecurity about languages other than english ) . nevertheless , we see from plato 's cratylus that differences between greek ( in its various diachronic forms ) and the  barbarian  languages was put to philosophical use . if you read cratylus , you ' ll see that plato , through socrates , was putting some value on philosophical arguments which brought in data from other languages . ( even though there 's a lot of sarcasm and tongue in cheek in the whole issue as plato treats it in cratylus , i . e . , whether the words of language are  natural  or  conventional  / are there  correct  words for ideas / concepts / things ? - - plato is always a polemicist , reacting to rival schools of thought . ) i would like to re-open the issue ( i think it was once opened before on the list ) about how different cultures  explain  language diversity , and whether there is a culture which prevents all individual members from being interested in language for its own sake . i do n't think that could logically be possible - - but what do i know ? in any case , this might give us some insights into the  prehistory of linguistics  , and also into the still present motivations of some linguists to attach themselves to this aspect of our culture . benji;Safe Email

   so I'll probably poke around at the sequences performance issues,Well, there's this wonderful piece of code in MhSeqExpand ...    # Hack to weed out sequence numbers for messages that don't exist
    foreach m $rseq {
        if ![file exists $mhProfile(path)/$folder/$m] {
            Exmh_Debug $mhProfile(path)/$folder/$m not found
            set ix [lsearch $seq $m]
            set seq [lreplace $seq $ix $ix]
        } else {
            # Real hack
            break
        }
    }which is going to run slow if a sequence happens to start with a bunch
of messages that don't exist.   I'm not sure why it is important that the
first message in the sequence returned exists, but not necessarily any
of the others, but I'm sure glad it is, as MhSeqExpand gets called lots,
and I don't know if I could cope if it were checking every file in the
sequences it is looking at, all the time...It may help to keep a list of the valid message numbers for the current
folder (though that would then need to be verified against changes to the
directory).   Does tcl have a directory read function?   I assume so...Mh_Sequence also goes and rereads the files (.mh_sequences and the
context file) but I'm not sure how frequently that one is called.   I'll email anything I figure out since I'm leaving town in less 
   than 48 hours.Have a good vacation.kre_______________________________________________

Government.
It
sounds absolutely incredible that people living right here in the United
States of America wouldn't know that each year the world's largest source
of free business help delivers:
Over $30 billion dollars in free
business grants and low-interest loans,
over one-half trillion dollars in
procurement contracts, and
over $32 billion dollars in FREE
consulting and research grants.
With an economy that remains
unpredictable, and a need for even greater economic development on all
fronts, the federal government is more willing than it ever has been before
to give you the money you need to own your own business and become your
own boss!
In
spite of the perception that people should not look to the government for
help, the great government give-away programs have remained so incredibly
huge that if each of the approximately 8 million businesses applied for
an equal share, they would each receive over $70,000.
Most
people never apply for FREE Business Grants because they somehow feel it
isn't for them, feel there's too much red-tape, or simply don't know who
to contact.The fact is, however, that people from all walks of life do
receive FREE GRANTS MONEY and other benefits from the government, and you
should also.Government Grants

act.DTLOpening arguments are set to begin early next month in Eldred vs. Ashcroft,
a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case that will decide the future of copyright
law, including how and when artists and writers can build upon the work of
others.....To heighten public awareness of the importance of the case an Internet
bookmobile is set to depart San Francisco next Monday on a trip that will
bring it to the steps of the Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C.,
before arguments wrap up. The van, which will be stopping at schools,
libraries and senior centers along the way, is equipped to provide free
high-speed access to thousands of literary and artistic works that are
already in the public domain.--------I had the opportunity to visit the Internet Archive about a month ago, and
saw the bookmobile under construction. It's a neat idea. Take an SUV, put a
small satellite dish on the top, and put a computer, printer, and binding
machine in the back. Voila -- people can search for a book, then print out a
copy right there on the spot. Quite literally on-demand printing. Total
fixed cost of the computer/printer/binding machine, if bought new (the IA
had the equipment donated) is under $10k.One of the goals is to show libraries across the country that they could, if
they wished, add these virtual holdings (public domain materials) to their
existing library, at a fixed cost most libraries can afford. This should be
compelling to small libraries in remote areas.- Jim

of interest or relevance: read it while online, too, and check 'em
out.In case you're wondering, we Bowdlerise colourful language (e.g.

AN INTERNET EIREANNACH............................Ping An Irish SongYet another Irish internet company, Octagon Technologies, closed for
good this week.  And after reading the phrase for what seemed like
the umpteen-thousandth time, we were idly wondering how many Irish
tech companies blamed their misfortunes on the global downturn:
http://makeashorterlink.com/?S35A63392Oh, so it's about 450 then.  Thanks, Google.*The death occurred recently of that great Irish washtub musician
Lonnie Donegan.  RIP.  This seems like an apt time therefore to
reflect on his many accomplishments: his virtuoso playing of
utensil-based instruments, his worldwide commercial success, his
place in history as King of Skiffle, and how he wiped billions of
yen off the value of the Tokyo stock market:
http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=373A9C4F.61B@time.life
(panic and subsequent 10+% decline of Tokyo Stock Exchange when Reuters
advised 'Lonnie Donnegan' was dead)
and also at
http://xsls.com?80
(to Japanese ears it sounded like Ronald Reagan).*UCD's Literary and Historical Society this week awarded an honorary
fellowship to the tediously brilliant American multidisciplarian Dr
Noam Chomsky.  Now the idea of some trifling college society
awarding a mere honorary fellowship actually sounds rather like an
insult to us, considering that Niall Quinn and Marian Finucane were
given *degrees* by DIT the very next day, but then Chomsky
apparently inspired some of Radiohead's most caterwaulingly blunted
songs, so we suppose it serves him right.  Anyway, if you're an
admirer of the great man's hermeutic genius, linguistic philosophy
or contentious views on US foreign policy, perhaps you might also
appreciate his amazing interview of Tom Hanks:
http://www.sadiethepilot.com/aaweb/tapes.htm#tomnnoamVery special thanks to IMHO's London correspondent Ray Butler for
this one.*Key IMHO contributor Sean Lynch quite realistically predicts a post-
Budget dole queue for all of us, and wonders if we'll miss those
cash-and-job cow multinationals when they're gone?   Not if their
Irish presence was as permanent and impressive as the world's
leading risk and insurance services firm, he concludes:
http://www.marsh.ie
(compare and contrast with, say, http://www.marsh.co.uk/)*Also: we've been remiss in the past in not featuring
EircomTribunal.com's stalwart and righteous campaigning against
Eircom's crippling rates and crippled infrastructure in this
country.  Well, we aim to redress that right now, by pointing out
(1) Their 'Banana Republic' international price comparison page at
http://www.eircomtribunal.com/dossier_banana_rep.html, which will
surely make you mad enough to
(2) Download and print out their marvellously bitter No More
Favours For You, Mr Eircom Employee flyer from
http://www.eircomtribunal.com/counterstrike_a2_nomore.html, designed
to be stuck under the windshields of the ubiquitous and bilious
blue/orange Eircom vans.
Now if only EircomTribunal.com could somehow could retrieve that
money we all lost on bloody Eircom shares...

IMHO'S PICK: JOB....................IMHO HO HO (AND A BOTTLE OF RUM)FATHER CHRISTMAS on a bike - Student - Giving out FREEBIES - Four
weeks.  No, not us telegraphing our worst nightmare to our shrink,
but a job description for a position that apparently pays enough.
Email tmckeagney@msn.com or hell, cycle into his perfume shop at 128
The Stephens Green Centre and show him what you can do.And hey, if you're a crazy maniac, that's great too.  It's about
time we had an Irish SANTACON - after all, no force on earth can
stop one hundred Santas, especially if they're drunk:
http://www.santarchy.com/
(from the San Francisco Police Report, the naughty Santas ... had
reeked (sic) havoc in the emporium ... in an un-Christmas like
fashion.)*Heh.  Disproving the stereotype that all accountants are boring:
some Dublin 2 company is looking for a Parti-time bookkeeper at
http://xsls.com?83*Our attention-deficient gaze also fell briefly this week onto a box
ad in a Sunday paper which is seeking private investors for an
ADVENTURE SPORTS RETAILING business in Dublin.  Now this probably
just means selling snowboards or something equally tame, but in our
imagination we see IMHO readers hunting elephants, dogfighting in
biplanes over the Wicklow Hills and abseiling down moon craters.
Just in case we're right, any smart, experienced partner/investor
looking for an equity stake/board position should express
interest to neptune@atomic.ie.You know, it might look like we're giving these people free

IMHO'S PICK: EVENT...........................Allow Us To DemonstrateFriday is BUY NOTHING DAY.  For the sake of your own mental health
and the socio-economic future, we urge you to give it a try.  It's
not that hard to get through 24 hours without a purchase, and those
corporate balance sheets sure look funny with a big pre-Christmas
hole in them.The official home of BND is of course Adbusters
(http://adbusters.org/campaigns/bnd/) and they have a run-down of
Irish activities at http://xsls.com?84... rather a disappointing line-up
at this late stage, although the Zombie-Shopping in Galway sounds
like fun - shame they're moving the day to Saturday, hopefully it's
not for purpose-defeating reasons (Friday?  Damn, I'm working the
late shift at McDonald's... how about Saturday?).  In addition and
elsewhere you can expect bring-and-trade markets, flypostering, free
stuff, public speaking and all the other happy faces of democratic
consumer agitation.  Punk's not dead!  Party for your right to
fight!  No Logo!  Hare Hare!  And so on.*We're now going to risk life and limb by mentioning an event which
is so diametrically opposed to the above that we might just bring
about the heat-death of the Internet by combining them in the one
newsletter.We speak of course of the benighted and spiritually-denuded sickness
of the TRILOGY FASHION SHOW in the RDS on December 4th, tickets
starting at just E50 (but rising to E395 + VAT, natch).  The
advertising for this bleak celebration focuses entirely on the most
beautiful women in the world who will grace the Simmonscourt
Pavilion with their airbrushed emptiness: Tyra Banks, Sophie Dahl
and Anna Kournikova (not the virus) are the only names we recognise.
You have to pore pretty closely over the small print of the press
ads to divine that it's the new Escada Collection (the who now?)
they're modelling.  And in an utterly appropriate and inevitable
partnership, tickets are available from the cultural sewage
treatment system that is Ticketmaster.

IMHO'S PICK: DOWNLOAD..................Transparent and UnaccountableGiven our internet focus and the subversive nature of our scurrilous
publishing agenda, there is only one possible download
recommendation this week.  It's the brilliant GHOSTZILLA browser, a
creation of architectural genius which brings office escapism to
heady new heights.Designed to facilitate inconspicuous worktime browsing, Ghostzilla
sits quietly and invisibly in the background until you summon it
with a special mouse movement.  It then adapts itself to your
currently-uppermost application, for example Micro$oft Word, leaving
Word's toolbars intact while showing web pages in a subtle grayed-
out wash in the main window.  Images appear in a subdued two-tone
unless you summon them, and the overall effect is to make it look
like you're working exactly as you should be.  A casual glance from
your Office Space boss as he paces past your cubicle shouldn't
detect anything that looks like browsing.  To think that someone
devoted their life to creating something so wonderfully juvenile!
It's a beautiful thing.  Go ghosting at
http://www.ghostzilla.com.

IMHO'S PICK: INTERNET^HWS................................ON YER BIKERoll up, roll up roll up!  Segue right this way!  Amazon is now
selling the celebrated SEGWAY (aka Ginger, aka IT) online, the hype
of the millennium finally made available to lowly consumers.  You're
only four months and five thousands bucks away from participating in
the future of transport, the most fundamental and significant
breakthrough in human evolution since the invention of the leg, the
spirit that can change the world, etc. etc.Get out your chequebook and get your Segway at
http://makeashorterlink.com/?N49A51392.*The perfect expression of our post-modern mania for meta-media
(whoah! Easy, Chomsky!) is the utterly compelling 'Hoax Photo Test'
at http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/tests/hoaxphototest.html(If you've seen this already, that's prolly 'cos the mighty B3TA.com
featured it last Friday - credit where it's due)*Imagine being able to run a Google-like search on your life, says
one of the prophets of doom behind MyLifeBits, an incredibly Dickian
personalised self-database being developed by - who else? -
Microsoft.  By cataloguing every single artifact of your life
history, storing everything in an online repository, you build a
searchable index of every conversation, document, movement, event
and action that you ever generate or perform.  It's a continuous
real-time alibi recorder.  It's a voluntary submission of every
second of existence to information overload.  It's a system that can
show you all the photos you were ever in, tell you exactly how many
phonecalls you've ever made, or retrieve an mpeg of you going to the
toilet in March, 1986:
http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993084Also: we knew that modern innovation was roaring ahead at a
blistering pace, but can MyLifeBits really allow time-shifting?

might just lead, check out this wonderful piece of short science

perspective Flash games (e.g. suicide bombers at

http://www.nat.vu.nl/~joost/complex/index.html.*We Irish are sometimes so uncultured, compared to our continental
cousins - even in things you'd expect us to be good at, like
vandalism.  Here we get inarticulate clowns with cans of red paint
daubing 666 on the gates of Cardinal Connell's palatial Drumcondra
residence... whereas in Paris, to pick an example out of the blue,
egghead situationists sneakily attach absurdist plaques (e.g. On
April 17, 1967, nothing happened here) onto public buildings:
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2478161.stm*Microsoft have co-opted the AmIHotOrNot concept, as is their wont, mixed
it up with a bit of Miss World, and come up with the 'Microsoft Office v.

LEGACY MEDIA.................There Was Nothing In The Air That NightIRISH TV: If you rush straight home from work after reading this on
Thursday, you might catch the second semi-final of corny but
challenging elimination quiz IT'S NOT THE ANSWER (RTE1, 17:30).
Come on the beardy guy!  The final's on at the same time tomorrow.
Calm down from all that excitement with the laughable one-hour FAIR
CITY murder trial special (RTE1, 20:00) - it's quite brilliant how
the risible scripts really bring out the absolute worst in truly
terrible actors.  Settle down with a few G&Ts to watch PRIME TIME on
the same channel at 21:30, where they're discussing Ireland's
alcoholic epidemic and its attendant social problems, or waste them
on either the bottom-scraping POLICE ACADEMY 3 (N2, 21:30) or the
geriatric 1978 blockbuster COMA (TG4, 22:05).Friday night, and after a hard day of buying nothing you can flop in
front of creepy Hitler doco SIX MOST EVIL MEN (N2, 21:00).  Near as
we can tell, the other evil men are Macauley Culkin in UNCLE BUCK
(TV3, 20:00), gossip columnist WINCHELL in a solid eponymous biopic
(N2, 21:30), the big boss bad guy - is it Kang? Kane? Cowen? - in
MORTAL KOMBAT (TG4, 21:25), Mel Gibson in predictable 80s drug
thriller TEQUILA SUNRISE (RTE1, 23:50), and Quentin Tarantino
jumping on his own bandwagon in DESTINY TURNS ON THE RADIO (TV3,
0:50).  Hang on, Dave Fanning might be one of the evil men too: he's
presenting THE LAST BROADCAST on Network 2 at 23:35.

which can compromise your system, read your address book/whitelist, and
sent themselves on, compromising a nonnegligible fraction of systems as
they go along. While mailing lists can be spam/worm amplifiers, I don't think this is
true for individual users even today. Moreover, worms which use email as
vector exist *only* because a single vendor ships mailers with broken
default settings, and insists to make documents executables. This makes
for very bad press, and eventually that vendor is going to wise up, and 
stop shipping as many broken wares (or people will switch to more secure

 Like everyone else, I had become a
slave to the IKEA nesting instinct.
If I saw something like clever coffee
table sin the shape of a yin and yang,
I had to have it. I would flip through
catalogs and wonder, What kind of dining
set defines me as a person? We used to
read pornography. Now it was the Horchow
Collection. I had it all. Even the glass
dishes with tiny bubbles and imperfections,
proof they were crafted by the honest,
simple, hard-working indigenous peoples of
wherever.
 - Jack, Fight Club 
In Fight Club, Tyler Durden destroys this nesting instinct by *bombing* 
Jack's apartment. Hmmmm.

Date: Not suppliedThe DoE has announced a high-speed data-transfer that runs on drillpipe, 
through a 4-inch diameter steel pipe immersed in electrically conductive mud 
at pressures up to 1000 atmospheres, temperatures up to 150 deg C, and with 
vibrational accelerations of hundreds of g's:     Now, with a high-speed, bi-directional communications link, a drilling 
    system's azimuth, inclination, pressure, temperature, loads and vibration, 
    along with information on rock characteristics near the drill bit, can be 
    evaluated almost instantly. Also, because of the ability to send high-speed 
    data through the drill pipe, technologies once thought unobtainable ï¿½ such 
    as collecting seismic data at the drill bit ï¿½ may now be possible.     With high-resolution seismic data collected ahead of the bit, operators 
    could steer the drill bit more precisely toward oil- and gas-bearing sweet 
    spots and away from less productive areas. This will enhance the efficiency 
    of oil and gas wells and reduce the number of wells needed to produce a 
    reservoir.  Link[1] Discuss[2] (_via /.[3]_)[1] http://www.fossil.energy.gov/techline/tl_intellipipe.shtml

502;glow ' 99 call for papers : glow 1999 the glow 99 colloquium will be organized by the research center for general linguistics ( zas ) in berlin from 29th to 31st march 1999 . the conference will then continue in potsdam on 1st april with parallel workshops organized by the potsdam university and lot ( netherlands graduate school of linguistics ) . themes of the conference main colloquium : universals workshops : phonetics in phonology sources for universals technical aspects of movement calls : the colloquium : universals the search for universals has always been at the center of interest in generative linguistics . fundamental claims about universal properties of language are what we build into the very architecture of the theory of ug : primitives ( features etc . ) , combinatorial operations ( merge ) , the operation ' move ' , interfaces with extralinguistic systems ( lf , pf ) , etc . alongside such formal universals , we also seek substantive universals in inventories , markedness patterns , feature hierarchies etc . such facts may reflect properties of ug itself or derive from extralinguistic sources . recent growth in crosslinguistic study opens new opportunities for extending the empirical base , confirming or challenging old generalizations and establishing new ones . at the same time , recent theoretical developments in both phonology and syntax lead to important questions concerning the formal and / or substantive nature of universals in language , and the quest for the exact sources of variation between languages . in phonology , universals have typically been assumed to exist in many different subcomponents , e . g . features , prosodic constituents . only in recent years , with the emergence of output-based evaluation systems , has the focus of interest in universals shifted to the study of constraints and their interaction . hence new questions arise : are all constraints universal in the sense that they are constitutive of grammar ? should we conceive of constraints as being exhaustive and ordered ? are there universals that constraint orderings have to obey ? are there different domains ( i . e . lexical and postlexical level ) where constraints apply ? are there language-specific constraints ? syntactic theory in the early 80 's assumed principles common to all languages to interact with various types of ' macro-parameters ' : one deep property from which several other properties derive ( e . g . pro-drop parameter ) . later , variation was attributed to ' micro-parameters ' . now , with the emergence of minimalism and optimality , basic issues like what constitutes a universal principle / constraint , and what constitutes a parameter , need to be re-addressed . is there a universal inventory of functional heads / features ? as to the autonomy of , or the division of labour between syntax and morphology : is parametrized variation confined to inflectional systems ? is syntactic variation restricted to the choice of overt or zero realization of a given feature ? if all movement takes place in a single cycle , does variation reduce to the presence of affixes or the lack thereof ? are there universal constraints in morpho-syntax ? moreover , in recent years it has been argued that thematic relations are features . what are their characteristics ? do these have a universal inventory ? could they be parametrized ? many typological-descriptive generalizations await theoretical integration - e . g . greenbergian ' universals ' of word order patterns , cross-categorial harmony effects , etc . in this respect , kayne 's proposal for a universal ordering merely shifts the burden from phrase structure to movement . a guiding heuristic of generative grammar has been that parsimonious ( redundancy-free ) theories are to be preferred , but minimalism goes further in suggesting that economy is built into ug itself . to what extent can the hypothesis that ug principles instantiate notions of economy be upheld ? in studying ug , we take the external systems with which it interfaces to be invariant in linguistically significant senses across individuals and languages . thus we posit universal interpretation mechanisms ( and uniformity across languages at lf ) , ' universal phonetics ' ( invariant articulatory / perceptual mechanisms ) , a universal parser , etc . , so that variation is confined to grammars , in particular phonology / morphology and&nbsp , aspects of the lexicon . yet properties of external systems may have far-reaching consequences for our view of ug . as we learn more about them , universals attributed to ug may have to be reassigned . what if ug - compatible grammars determine languages that cannot exist because they are unuseable ( unparseable , unlearnable , etc ) ? are there universal patterns in the acquisition process , in parsing strategies , etc . , that can be brought to bear ? the colloquium will consist of 20 talks of 45 minutes each plus discussion . abstracts may not exceed 2 pages with at least a 1 inch margin on all four sides and should employ a font not smaller than 12 pt . they should be sent anonymously in tenfold , accompanied by a camera-ready original with the author 's name , address and affiliation to : glow selection committee c / o artemis alexiadou zentrum fr allgemeine sprachwissenschaft , typologie und universalienforschung jgerstr . 10 / 11 , 10117 berlin germany phone : + 49-30 - 20192404 / 1 fax : + 49-30 - 20192402 e-mail : glow99 @ zas . gwz-berlin . de url : http : / / www . zas . gwz-berlin . de / events / glow / index . htm the workshops 1 . sources for universals recent developments in syntax and phonology such as the minimalist program or optimality theory have led to new insights into the structure of the human linguistic capacity . in the context of such theoretical developments , the conviction has grown that recourse to innate properties of language cannot be the only explanation for the existence of certain generalizations of formal linguistic structure . the idea of the workshop  sources for universals  is to bring together researchers from various fields inside and outside of syntax and phonology in order to identify possible sources for formal universals of natural language . such possible sources could come from the following domains , semantic universals consideration of processing difficulty considerations of laws of historical development for languages considersations of constraints on language acquisition biological constraints in the sense of a  universal grammar  constraints inherent in the computational mechanisms serving language , this list is not meant to be exhaustive . contributions which link formal universals as discussed in recent grammatical models to any of such sources are particularly welcomed . 2 . technical aspects of movement filler - gap dependencies ( fgd ) belong to the most intriguing properties of natural language grammatical theories have to deal with . finding the right approach continues to be a matter of no little controversy . capturing the core properties of fgds , concepts of strictest c-command , which require fillers and their gaps to be immediately attached to the same projection line , arguably possess a high amount of naturalness or simplicity . this type of constraint is directly reflected by linear indexed grammars and has been implemented in the minimalist extension condition on structure building . ( attempts to derive the c-command relation from the minimalist operation merge take this strategy even further . ) yet , head-movement configurations , analyzed as adjunction in the principles and parameters variant of generative grammar , seem to require weaker versions of c-command , such that the adjoined head ' inherits ' the c-command domain of the head adjoined to . it is an open question , whether there are alternatives that do not - one way or the other - employ similar auxiliary devices . as is well known , fgd - patterns ( nested / crossed ) have consequences for the generative power of the grammars describing them . it is not properly understood , however , which devices of which systems capture less orderly patterns best . systems using slash-categories or similar techniques seem to run into considerable difficulty here . feature - lists integrated into a checking theory of movement may be considered one of various alternatives . most recently , the minimalist adoption of the  copy theory of movement  opened up another array of related issues . how , for example , do checking resources get eliminated if each step leading to elimination is preceded by a step of copying these resources ? are copies of np / wh - moved constituents assumed to retain properties of empty anaphors and syntactic variables respectively , or has any reference to empty categories ( e . g . ecp ) and their potential link to binding theory become undefined ? if the latter , could this change be motivated by complexity results concerning the powerful device of free indexation , as employed by gb binding theory ? indeed , a general ban on the use of indices has been accompanying the  copy theory of movement  . this calls for a demonstration how chains , the standard  legitimate lf - objects  , which in alternative versions of syntax are supposed to fully supplant movement , get handled without such devices . primary properties to be defined on chains of copies , for example , would be pf - realizability as well as the distinction between operator , variable , and descriptive content status at lf ( nontrivial consequences for the analyses of qr and acd being directly implied ) . alternatively , it would be helpful to be able to appreciate how far any worked-out proposals deviate from structure-sharing techniques as used in hpsg / lfg ( a . o . ) , index percolation devices from variants of indexed grammar , and other structure generating systems like tree adjoining grammar or categorial grammar . this workshop invites submissions of papers shedding light on the above questions from both technical / formal and linguistic angles . abstracts for both workshops are invited for 45 minute presentations ( plus 15 minutes dicussion ) . they should not exceed one page / 500 words . please send five anonymous copies plus a camera ready original ( with author 's name , address , and affiliation ) to the address specified below . speakers will be partially reimbursed for their expenses on the scale that applies to the colloquium . glow workshops c / o matthias schlesewsky institut fuer linguistik universitt potsdam postfach 60 15 53 d 14415 potsdam germany phone : x49 - 331-977 - 2016 fax : x49 - 331-977 - 2761 e-mail : glow _ workshop @ ling . uni-potsdam . de url : http : / / www . ling . uni-potsdam . de / ik / glow . html 3 . phonetics in phonology invited speakers : edward flemming , donca steriade organizers : carlos gussenhoven , ren kager the workshop is broadly concerned with the relevance of articulatory and perceptual facts for phonological theory . more specifically , it intends to focus on such questions as the extent to which functional factors determine phonological grammars , the status of the distinction between phonological representation and phonetic implementation , the issue of multiple ( articulation-based as well as perception-based ) phonological representations , and the universality and ` groundedness ' of phonological constraints . the workshop will consist of approximately 7 talks of 45 minutes each , followed by 15 minutes of discussion . abstracts may not exceed one page with at least a 1 inch margin on all four sides and should employ a font no smaller than 12 pt . they should be sent anonymously in threefold , accompanied by a camera-ready original with the author 's name , address and affiliation , to glow phonology workshop c / o . ren kager utrecht institute of linguistics / ots trans 10 3512 jk utrecht netherlands phone : + 31-30 - 2538064 fax : + 31-30 - 2536000 deadline for submission of abstracts : december 1 , 1998 submission by fax or e-mail will not be accepted .;Safe Email

However,I am in search of a reliable and trustworthy person that can handle a confidential transaction of this nature.I am BARRISTER ADEWALE COKER, a family lawyer to our former military rule,General Sani Abacha who died suddenly in power some years ago. Since his untimely demise, the family has suffered a lot of harassment from the regimes that succeeded him.  The regime and even the present civilian government are made up of Abacha's enemies.Recently, the wife was banned from traveling outside Kano State their home state as a kind of house arrest and the eldest son still in detention.Although, a lot of money have been recovered from Mrs. Abacha since the death of her husband by the present government, there's still huge sums of money in hard currencies that we have been able to move out of the country for safe keeping to the tune of US$50 million.This money US$50 Million is already in North American and if you are interested,we will prepare you as the beneficiary of the total funds,and you will share 25% of the total funds after clearance from the Security Company.Note, there is no risk involved in this project because l am involved as Abacha's confidant.Please you should keep this transaction a top secret and we are prepared to do more business with you pending your approach towards this project.I await your urgent response.Thanks.

507;they were plenty upset about the tea taxes.But the crack down on colonial script certainly screwed over the American Colonies. And, BTW, England as well.Dear Ben Franklin was right for the wrong reasons. First of all the colonies were not prosperous compared to England proper. Second, the issuance of colonial script had nothing to do with full employeement.(In fact, it is almost inconceivable he would make that claim. It sounds like a modern Keynsian was creating an urban legend.)OTOH the lack of sufficient circulating monetary instruments was economically crippling. Imagine trying to buy your supplies by offering IOUs on your own name -- and then trying to market / exchange the paper as the merchant who took the IOU.===========================The most common problem in the world is when a government prints too much money. The effects are a complete disaster. There are a lot of incentives that push governments into doing this even though it is incredibly stupid.So almost all the literature talks about that.But you can ALSO screw an economy over by taking all the money out of circulation. The fundamental cause of the American Great Depression was exactly this, courtesy of the Federal Reserve Board.I don't think shifting the power to print money to the bank of Canada had much effect. And Canada is still a prosperous country. > -----Original Message----- > From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of Gary > Lawrence Murphy > Sent: Saturday, September 21, 2002 7:31 AM > To: Mr. FoRK > Cc: fork@spamassassin.taint.org > Subject: Re: sed /s/United States/Roman Empire/g > > >>>>> f == fork list writes: > > f> Free trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift > f> whole societies out of poverty I'm not a > f> socio-political/history buff - does anybody have some clear > f> examples? > > China?

July 10, 2002 Greetings from Download.com!
If you're developing Windows applications in an
ActiveX-compatible environment (which includes most major ones
such as Visual Basic and C++), it's time you started taking
advantage of prefab programming components. An amazing array of
controls are out there, with more arriving at Download.com
every day. This week, we've collected the top programs that
handle transparent GIF files, offer prebuilt ActiveX controls,
and edit hex code to get you up and running.Also this week, we've got two really useful ActiveX entries:
FileSystem 1.2 and AppSecureX 2.9. FileSystem gives you access
to drives, folders, and I/O operations, and AppSecureX adds
serial number and shareware-type functionality to your
applications.Becky Waring
Contributing Editor, CNET Download.com
From Builder.comSix
MySQL/PHP functions to streamline development
Code reuse is one of the keys to increasing developer
     productivity. This article looks at several handy functions
     you can use to save time when building applications using
     PHP and MySQL.Faking
SOAP principles with familiar techniques
SOAP is everywhere you turn. But what exactly is it? Take
     this guided tour to gain working knowledge of this emerging
     standard.in ActiveX
FileSystem 1.2
Having problems wrangling the Windows File System? The
   FileSystem ActiveX control offers complete access to common
   file information under Windows through three independent
   interfaces. Everything from drive and folder access to file
   I/O operations is available with only a few lines of code.
   Use this control's interfaces to detect media types and
   media insertion, get complete lists of folders and files at
   unlimited folder depth, find out what attributes are set on
   files, and even load logbook files into collections
   automatically. Rope in your files.
ApSecureX 2.9
Prevent pirates from copying your software with AppSecureX.
   This control provides a registration system that produces a
   valid serial number customized to the user's machine. When
   the user installs your software, a unique ID number is
   generated for that system. To get the serial number, the
   user must provide you with his installation number. The
   data file created by the application is encrypted
   differently for each system, so even if someone were to
   crack the file, they couldn't use the information on
   another machine. AppSecure can also give your software
   shareware functionality such as number of days left, checking
   to see if the system clock is set back, and so on. AppSecureX
   works with any ActiveX-enabled programming language such as
   Microsoft Visual Basic or Microsoft Visual C++. A demo
   application is included. Lock up your software.
in Java
AppletFile 2.5
AppletFile is a set of Java applets that will enhance your
   Web site's file upload and download capabilities. In
   addition to support for SSL, proxy, and authenticated
   uploading, users can upload and download multiple files
   using predefined paths to automate the process as much as
   possible. A scripting language provides for sophisticated
   customization, and the user interface includes support for
   12 different languages. Transfers are faster because the
   applet uses its own compression (AutoZIP). The AutoSYNC
   feature downloads only updated files, and verification of
   file transfer integrity is made possible with built-in
   support for MD5 message digests. AppletFile is based on
   HTTP protocols and is firewall-friendly. This update adds
   Sun's Java Plug-in support for Netscape 6+ browsers and
   shows removable media drives in the browse dialog. Beam up
   your files.
in Tools & Editors
PHP Master Editor 2.0
Write, edit, and debug PHP scripts and HTML pages with this
   tool. PHP Master Editor includes an internal browser for
   viewing, as well as a debugger for local testing. Basic FTP
   capability is also included. Specifically designed for PHP
   programmers, the program recognizes and formats functions,
   variables, and classes within the code, and features
   customizable code templates. Get code-happy.Â

simply fax your check to : 808-878 - 6869 so do n't hesitate , call today this offer is for a limited time only ! what is express mail server ? express mail server ( ems ) bulk e-mail software is the only thing that works . ems transforms your computer into a personal mail server . with no additional hardware , ems software will give you complete control of your mailings , because the mail you send will originate from your computer and be delivered directly into the mailbox of your recipient . since the mail originates from your computer , it is no longer necessary to use your internet service provider 's mail server . when you use the previous generation stealth or cloaking type programs , they work by uploading your mail to your provider 's mail server . they can also be programmed to send mail through other providers mail servers without authorization ( this is considered theft of service ) . the problem is , the previous generation stealth type programs upload the messages faster than these mail servers can process them . many times this causes a provider 's mail server to bog down and crash . obviously , this will make providers furious with you . furthermore , you may think that you are sending hundreds of thousands of messages , unfortunately , most of it simply gets filtered and deleted by the mail server . you are lucky to get 10 % - 20 % of that mail delivered . with ems software your computer emulates a mail server and you actually control and watch all your mail being delivered piece by piece . there is a 100 % delivery rate with this program anywhere on the internet . we did say 100 % delivery rate to any internet email addresses . a bold claim but it is true . this is the latest technical advance in bulk email since the advent of the stealth type programs . this program verifies domains and validity of email addresses before sending mail . this dramatically reduces your bounced back undeliverables . bounced back undeliverables can sure bog down a server . you can also control where you want any bounced back mail to go . it can go to any email address you want with ems . ems can work with any dial up internet account , ( aol is not considered a dial up internet account ) an isdn line or a t - 1 or t - 3 . it runs on windows 95 or nt . we have not heard of any person losing a dial up account with this software . one reason bulk email is so frowned upon with numerous isp 's ( internet service providers ) is people try to send as much mail as they can , as quick as they can and crash the mail server of the isp . this won't happen with ems software since you do n't since you do n't use the mail server of the isp to send your mail . the program actually sends the mail directly from your computer , which is now , a bona fide mail server , to the recipients mail server avoiding any potential blocks that would prevent you from reaching those on your mailing list . you do not have to  forge  headers or randomize anything to have 100 % of your mail delivered , although the program does allow for randomization and customizing of headers . you can send mail omitting the  to   from  and  reply to  portions of your headers . want to send out your messages in color . this is not a problem with ems . just select a font color with your mouse , and then click on a background color as well . want to make your font bold or put it into italics , just point and click . want your message centered or shifted left or right , once again just point and click . unlike all of the others , ( which are all the same , but go by different names ) this software is very straightforward and easy to use . if you can log on to aol , you already know more about computers than you 'd need to use ems . we also provide technical support by phone to answer any questions you may have . ems works with any windows 95 or nt computer . it requires no additional hardware or software . the ems software sends at speeds up to 80 , 000 messages per hour delivered using a modest pentium and a 28 . 8 modem . rates will dramatically increase with an isdn or cable modem and of course with a t - 1 they will be even faster . if you want to take advantage of this breakthrough in bulk email technology give us a call on the number below . we do n't plan on repeat mailings for this product so take advantage of this opportunity . the cost to you is $ 275 . 00 ! money well spent if you consider that you can buy stealth ( or the many others like it . . . they all operate the same way ) for $ 400 . you might be happy with stealth if you do n't mind frequent loss of dial-up accounts , and lot of complaints . not getting a lot of your mail delivered due to blocks and crashed mail servers deleting your mail , along with the resulting low response rate from your mailings , all of which defeated the purpose of e-mailing in the first place ! few people are aware of this new technology , so you are already leaps and bounds ahead of any competition . using this , you can sell anything you wish , over and over . also , consider that you may decide to offer a mailing service to others . you ' ve probably gotten e-mails that claim they can send your advertisement e-mail for a cost of $ 200 per 100 , 000 . what most people do n't realize is that only 20 or 30 of the mail they pay these people to get sent actually gets delivered ! this mailing service is very profitable , and using this software , you can advertise that service to millions for free ! we also have cd roms with 60 million addresses to help you start . with your purchase , visit our web site at : http : / / 138 . 27 . 44 . 5 . cearth . on . ca / users / imc ( if you can't log into the site just call us , sometime the site is overloaded with hits ) call i . m . c at : phone : ( 808 ) 876-1550 fax : ( 808 ) 878-6869 and place your order today while supplies last and we ' ll be happy to send you a demo copy and answer any questions you may have . or call us and we will give you our full service web site addresses to be removed from our mailing list or to be added to our  global remove list  simply go to : http : / / www . ctct . com all remove requests are respectfully immediately;Phishing Email

The chances are that the next time you pick up an external computer peripheral, it will be utilizing USB 2.0 to connect to your computer. So what is USB 2.0? Is it that much faster than USB 1.1?

Well if you have similar questions, I gathered up some discussion on this topic in hopes that it will bring a better understanding of what's in store for USB 2.0. Take your pick. USB vs. USB 2.O

Date: Not suppliedJohn Robb has an interesting perspective on trust-based, targetted advertising
[1] based on his experiences at Gomez during the heady days of the Internet 
gold rush. Nobody believes advertisements[2] any more. There's a lot of evidence that 
advertising just doesn't work, no matter how targetted, so if you have a 
product to sell you have no choice but to get into the editorial side, where 
consumers' defenses are lowered. Product placements are one example of this. There is an unfortunate tragedy of the commons, here. When advertising first 
rose to prominence, advertisements _did_ work. We hadn't built up our 
immunities yet. As more and more advertisers used the opportunity of the medium 
to lie, we learned not to trust advertisements. But we still trust editorial. 
And once editorial gets polluted by desperate marketers using PR instead 
of advertising to promote their message, nobody will believe it either.[1] http://jrobb.userland.com/stories/2002/09/11/trustbasedAdvertising.html

weather, your representatives are heatedly working to improve the Wall Street 
mess. Letï¿½s hope they donï¿½t make it worse. Jennifer Hickey tells all in her 
revealing Washingtonï¿½s Week piece http://insightmag.com/news/258785.html. And Zoli Simon has discovered that the Chinese have targeted Russian cruise 
missiles at U.S. ships. Read all about it 
http://insightmag.com/news/258778.html. And guess which party is poised to 
become a major force in time for the November elections? Hint ï¿½ Itï¿½s not the 
Republicans or Democrats http://insightmag.com/news/258781.html. Along with the 
usual reliable revelations and opinions described below. ï¿½Bye for now. >>From the 
Bunker, I remain your newsman in Washington................................................CHINA ARMS FOR WARZoli Simon writes that China's acquisition of cruise-missile weapons systems 
from Russia poses a clear and present danger to U.S. naval forces ï¿½ and to the 
American homeland as well.http://insightmag.com/news/258778.html...............................................WASHINGTONï¿½S WEEK ï¿½ ON THE LEGISLATIVE WARPATHJennifer Hickey tells us as investor anger registered more clearly with each 
downward tick of the stock markets, legislators engaged in an indelicate 
parliamentary exchange of whoops about arcane congressional rules while they 
danced and ululated to mutual charges of chicanery.http://insightmag.com/news/258785.html...............................................TAX CODE TRAUMAJohn Berlau tells us that experts contend that simplifying the U.S. tax code 
would do more to cut down on corporate-accounting chicanery than the 
introduction of still more regulations and criminal penalties.http://insightmag.com/news/258763.html ========================================               Is Bin-Laden the Pawn of China?On September 11, 2001, a Chinese Peoples Liberation Army transport aircraft from 
Beijing landed in Kabul with the most important delegation the ruling Taliban 
had ever received.  They had come to sign the contract with Afghanistan that 
Osama bin-Laden had asked for, that would provide the Taliban state of the art 
air defense systems in exchange for the Taliban's promise to end the attacks by 
Muslim extremists in China's north-western regions.  Hours later, CIA Director 
George Tenet received a coded red alert message from Mossad's Tel Aviv 
headquarters that presented what he called a worst case scenario -- that China 
would use a ruthless surrogate, bin-Laden, to attack the United States.  In 
SEEDS OF FIRE, Gordon Thomas asks the question: In the war on terror, is China 
with us or against us?  Click here:

inventory of property stolen from Jews by the Nazis, a new tide of anti-Semitism 
is sweeping the country.http://insightmag.com/news/258764.html...............................................ï¿½PARTY OF PRINCIPLEï¿½ GAINING GROUNDDoreen Englert says, once an afterthought on the U.S. political landscape, the

530;hi all,I'm looking to get my hands on
either Doom I or II for my PC.
Unfortunately I cannot access 
IDSoftware's site because of
the silly web-filtering system
in place here.Does anyone know where I can
buy a copy of Doom (which I will
be running on Linux...) online?
Last time I asked in Game they laughed
at me ,]I would ask to swap for Linux software
but that wouldn't be ethical or legal.
Hence the purchasing question.Regards,
Shane--

 Judgment Courses offers an extensive Audio training
course in 
 How to Collect Money Judgments
  .          S6 If you are like many people, you are not even sure what a
Money Judgment is and 
 why processing Money Judgments
can earn you very substantial income
  .If you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you
will have a Money Judgment against them.You are happy you won but you will soon find out the
shocking fact: Its now up to you to collect on the
Judgment. The court does not require the loser to pay you.
The court will not even help you. You must trace the loser
down, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts,
real estate, stocks and bonds, etc.Very few people know how to find these assets or what to do
when they are found. The result is that millions of
Judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten.In 79% of the cases the winner of a Judgment never sees a
dime.The non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic
proportions. Right now in the United States there is
between 
 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollected Money
Judgment debt
  . For every Judgment that is paid, 5 more
Judgments take its place.We identified this massive market 8 years ago and have
actively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented this
business. We have perfected it into a well proven and solid
profession in which only a select few will be trained in the
techniques necessary to succeed.With our first hand experience we have built a course which
teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown
and exciting field of processing Money Judgments.By following the steps laid out in our course and with
reasonable effort you can become very successful in the
processing of Money Judgments.The income potential is substantial in this profession. 
 We
have associates who have taken our course and are now
working full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per
year. Part time associates are earning between $24,000.00
and $100,000.00 per year 
 . Some choose to operate out of
their home and work by themselves. Others build a sizable
organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business
offices.Today our company and our associates have over 126
million dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently
processing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form
of joint ventures between our firm and our associates.
Joint ventures are where we make our money. We only break
even when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin on
the reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting
capability is so extensive that government agencies, police
officers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us
for reports.
Many of our associates already have real estate liens in
force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars.
Legally this means that when the properties are sold or
refinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10%
interest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments.
Annual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to
$500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the
payment of the principal.Our associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per
year. This is just for interest, not counting principle
and not counting the compounding of the interest which can
add substantial additional income. Typically companies are
sold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interest
an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell
their business for approximately 2.5 million dollars.
 92% of all of our associates work out of their home, 43%
are women and 36% are part time
  .One of the benefits of working in this field is that you are
not under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off
for a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you are
working on will be there when you return. The Judgments
are still in force, they do not disappear.The way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your
computer and telephone to do most of the processing. You
never confront the debtor. The debtor doesn't know who you
are. You are not a collection agency.Simply stated the steps to successful Money Processing
are as follows:Mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals
with Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out who
to write to)8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you
and ask for your help. They call you, you don't call them
unless you want to.You send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to
sign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and
50% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for
$2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.You then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor
and their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports to
assist you. They range from credit reports from all three
credit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment
locates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.
The prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to
1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge
$6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other
companies charge $25.00.Once you find the debtor and their assets you file
garnishments and liens on the assets you have located.
(Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the
course)When you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to
the original Judgment holder.Once the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of
Judgment to the court. (Included in the course)Quote's from several of our students:Thomas in area code 516 writes us: I just wanted to drop
you a short note thanking you for your excellent course. 
 My
first week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars
  . Your
professionalism in both the manual and the video opened
doors for me in the future. There's no stopping me now.
Recently Thomas states he has over $8,500,000 worth of
judgments he is working on.After only having this course for four months, Larry S. in
area code 314 stated to us:  
 I am now making $2,000.00 per
week 
 and expect this to grow to twice this amount within the
next year. I am having a ball. I have over $250,000 in
judgments I am collecting on now.After having our course for 7 months Larry S. in 314 stated
 
 I am now making $12,000.00
  per month and have approximately
$500,000.00 in judgments I am collecting on. Looks like I
will have to hire someone to help outMarshal in area code 407 states to us I feel bad, you only
charged me $259.00 for this course and it is a goldmine. I
have added 3 full time people to help me after only having
your course for 5 months>From the above information and actual results you can see
why we can state the following:With our course you can own your own successful business.
A business which earns you substantial income now and one
which could be sold in 3-5 years, paying you enough to
retire on and travel the world. A business which is
extremely interesting to be in. A Business in which every
day is new and exciting.None of your days will be hum-drum. Your brain is
Challenged. A business, which protects you from Corporate
Downsizing. A business which you can start part time from
your home and later, if you so desire, you can work in full
time. A business, which is your ticket to freedom from
others telling you what to do. A business, which lets you
control your own destiny. Our training has made this happen
for many others already. Make it happen for you!If the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you
to talk to a real live human being, no cost or obligation
on your part.
 Please call us at 1_406_652_0194 
 .We have 
 Customer Support staff available to you from 8:00am to
9:00pm (Mountain Time) 7 days a week
  . If you call this number
you can talk to one of our experienced Customer Support personnel.
They can answer any questions you may have - with no obligation.
Sometimes we run special pricing on our courses and combinations
of courses. When you call our Customer Support line they can let
you know of any specials we may be running. If you like what you
read and hear about our courses, then the Customer Support person
can work with you to place your order. We are very low key. We
merely give you the facts and you can then decide if you want to
work with us or not.Thank you for your time and interest.

( wraps financial - creditquality - moodys and financial - defaults - s & p ) by jonathan stempel new york , oct 29 ( reuters ) - corporate credit quality will likely grow much worse before it gets better , and about $ 100 billion of corporate debt will likely go into default this year as the united states heads into recession , according to reports issued on monday by two top credit rating agencies . moody ' s investors service said it put ratings on review for downgrade for 122 u . s . companies with $ 543 billion of debt in the third quarter , dwarfing the 22 companies with $ 66 billion of debt it put on review for upgrade . reviews are a leading indicator of the direction of corporate credit .  a wide excess of rating reviews for downgrade over upgrades in the third quarter suggests credit deterioration will persist at least into early next year ,  said john puchalla , moody ' s senior economist . meanwhile , standard & poor ' s said more than 200 companies will default on about $ 100 billion of debt this year , compared with 117 defaulting on a record $ 42 . 3 billion in 2000 . it said the default rate for junk bonds - those rated  bb - plus  or lower by s & p and  bal  or lower by moody ' s because of their credit risks - will reach 9 . 4 percent by year end . moody ' s forecasts a 10 percent rate .  the u . s . economy is clearly in a recession ,  said s & p chief economist david wyss in a statement .  although standard & poor ' s expects it to be relatively mild and end in early 2002 , the risk of a longer and deeper downturn is high .  both agencies said the sept . 11 attacks contributed to a deepening of a three - year slump in corporate credit quality . moody ' s blamed 38 reviews for downgrade in september alone on the attacks . costs rise , protection weakens u . s . corporate credit quality is falling for many reasons . these include the weakening economy , the inability of many marginal companies to raise cash at tolerable interest rates , share buybacks , debt - financed merger activity , and fallout from the attacks on such industries as airlines , insurance and travel .  many companies in financial difficulties will see their funding sources dry up and be pushed over the brink ,  said david keisman , managing director at s & p risk solutions . even well - known companies are suffering rating declines . on monday alone , for example , s & p downgraded mcdonald corp . after the world ' s largest fast - food chain said it will buy back up to $ 5 billion of stock , at a time s & p said the company ' s  growth prospects for the future are less optimistic .  meanwhile , moody ' s downgraded enron corp . , and warned it may downgrade it again . the energy trading giant is struggling with vanishing investor confidence , reflected in a share price that has plunged by more than half in two weeks , as it tries to keep access to cash it needs to run its business . puchalla said the credit quality decline could slow next year , in part because interest rates are low and companies are managing their balance sheets more conservatively .  lower borrowing costs and slowing debt growth should reduce debt servicing costs , and fiscal stimulus from the federal government should boost business revenues ,  he said . still , through friday , moody ' s has said in the fourth quarter it may downgrade 47 companies , and upgrade just four . copyright ?

shares of enron fell further monday after moody ' s investors service downgraded enron ' s long - term debt a notch . enron , which hit a 52 - week high of $ 84 . 88 on dec . 29 , was well on its way to another year low monday . heading for a ninth straight day of losses , enron shed more than 9 percent , or $ 1 . 41 , to $ 13 . 99 . the stock was again the most active mover on the new york stock exchange as close to 28 million shares had changed hands . moody ' s said it cut the senior unsecured long - term debt to baa 2 from baal , and the ratings remain on review for potential additional downgrades . the action follows enron ' s reported $ 1 . 01 billion charge in the third quarter and was driven by the expectation of further write - downs and the swift deterioration of the company ' s financial picture , said stephen moore , vice president at moody ' s .  however , we do feel the move enron made to draw down their revolvers to pay off their commercial paper was a smart business move ,  said stephen moore , vice president at moody ' s . the rating agency said it would review the prime - 2 rating on enron ' s commercial paper . last thursday , enron announced it had tapped its lines of credit to provide more than $ 1 billion in cash liquidity and that would it use $ 2 billion to pay down commercial paper . the decision to pay off the commercial paper , he said , accomplishes two goals .  it increases liquidity on a short - term basis , and additionally , it enables them to focus on other areas they need to focus on right now ,  moore said .  they are working on setting up an additional facility for further capital to support their wholesale trading business .  karen denne , an enron spokesperson , confirmed monday that the company is in discussions with banks for further financing . additional credit would help boost enron ' s liquidity position . the lingering concern for moody ' s is that there  yet may be something else out there that gets to the credibility issue of enron itself ,  moore said . at the heart of the credibility issue are two limited partnerships - - lmj and lmj 2 - created in 1999 by former cfo andy fastow and since dissolved . enron ousted fastow last week . see related story .  the market was unaware ,  of the existence of the partnerships , moore said .  quite frankly , we don ' t think there is anything else ,  he said .  but enron is huge , and if this could happen . . . there is a lingering concern that something else might happen . we cannot confirm or deny that this is true . we will be meeting soon with them to resolve issues such as these .  moore said the meeting could come as soon as this week .  should the wholesale trading business and the counterparties therein become impacted by these events , that could lead to the slowing growth of the wholesale business , the enron engine ,  he said . moody ' s action monday also negatively affected the ratings on two trusts - - marlin water trust and osprey , which have combined debt of $ 3 . 2 billion . marlin is now rated baa 2 , while osprey carries a new rating of baa 3 , both down a notch . the potential issue for the trusts may be  how much equity enron would have to issue if the sale of the underlying assets alone isn ' t enough to pay off the debt .  enron is anticipating using the proceeds from the sale of assets to meet its obligation . lisa sanders is a dallas -

- with the average age of enron employees at under 35 - - and they in turn helped fuel an explosion in residential growth in houston ' s downtown . this , in turn , helped revitalize downtown ' s retail and restaurant scene . enron ' s construction of a large class a office tower , still going up , is a milestone in houston ' s growth , an official end to more than a decade of large amounts of vacant office space . virtually every civic or charitable activity in houston learned to count on enron for both financial support and thousands of hours of invaluable volunteer activities . if enron or its chairman , ken lay , led a visionary effort , such as hosting the meeting of g 7 trade ministers , or more recently the private funding of the houston biotechnology center , houstonians knew it would be done right . without lay our town would have lost major league baseball and status as a big league town . employees know enron set a standard for hiring and promoting employees based on their potential , with no glass ceilings . women have run large divisions and subsidiaries . many military officers find that enron called on their talents after illustrious military careers , even at ages well past normal corporate entry level . the most highly recruited young people flock to a company that invests heavily in their training and then lets them rise as far and fast as their talent and ability to work hard would allow them . enron ' s corporate success reflects the stories of so many of its employees who have lived the american dream . with the habits of work learned on a family farm in missouri , ken lay got an education ending with a graduate degree at the university of houston , served his country in government and began a career in the gas pipeline business . when northern natural gas acquired the smaller houston natural gas , northern ' s chairman surprised folks by installing lay as his successor . i was at northern ' s headquarters in omaha the week after the merger 16 years ago when northern ' s chairman reassured folks that they could count on  best young executive in the business , ken lay ,  to direct their future in a changing marketplace . within 15 years , most of enron ' s revenues and profits came from businesses that did not even exist when lay had taken over , all of which had been created from within the firm . this success did not diminish the farm boy decency and sense of fairness that attracted top talent to his team . enron rewarded innovation , while many firms afraid to alter the old formula wondered why their leadership eroded . year after year , top executives throughout the country voted enron our nation ' s most innovative corporation . enron recognized , even when financial markets do not , that innovative firms are secure enough to accept occasional failure and the inevitable price of other successes . rather than seeking insulation from the international marketplace , as had many american businesses , enron welcomed the challenge of the international market , confident that american firms could compete and win . enron also welcomed the challenge of responsible environmental stewardship , and called on industry to address the issue of global warming even as some companies feared the impact of pollution control on their bottom line . enron ' s phenomenal success created incredible and perhaps unreasonable expectations , as early this year when the stock market valued the company based on 20 percent annual growth , forever . enron ' s size and success made it a convenient target for politicians in california and india , even as enron supplied the electricity they so needed . sometimes it seemed the company ' s upstart origins as the david battling utility goliaths delayed the firm ' s perception that it had won and no longer played the role of an underdog . and so if enron experiences problems , it will learn from them , just as strong people do . let ' s not prejudge enron ' s current challenges . the more than a decade of my life that was dedicated to trying cases against companies who hurt consumers and investors taught me both to insist on the truth but never to jump to premature conclusions based on a headline or a news story . throughout its years of success , enron folks have never forgotten to find so many ways to make the firm ' s hometown of houston a better place to live and work . as enron enters a new phase of its life , let ' s not forget to express thanks and steady support . white is a houston business executive and civic leader and former government official , with no relationship to enron .;Safe Email

Just an area of the beach by the prom where he's allowed to make his
sculptures.
Weymouth is where I spent my teenage years. My mum and one sister still live
there.
So I'm pretty familiar with the sculptures, pretty impressive, and very big.
(I think he uses some sort of armature for some bits - it's not just sand)
They usually get vandalised, though, after a lot of drinks, it obviously is
a good idea to break into the enclosure and kick all the sculptures to bits.
Then again, Weymouth is pretty run down, and attracts holiday makers of the
worst sort.------------------------ Yahoo! Groups Sponsor ---------------------~-->

' state govt . to renegotiate dabhol power project , by hubert vaz the economic times , friday apr 27 2001 dpc board empowers md to cancel mseb contract the enron power project crisis on thursday deepened with the board of dabhol power company authorising the management to issue a termination notice to the maharashtra state electricity board even while international lenders to the project asked enron to renegotiate power purchase agreement signed with the mseb . the decision to authorise managing director neil mcgregor to issue  notice of termination on the contract to sell 740 mw of power  was taken after the board prevented mseb from voting on the ground that it was an interested party . the decision was taken with six votes in favour and the single opposition vote was cast by idbi , sources said . according to reports , financial institutions such as anz investment bank , credit suisse first boston , citibank , abn - amro and the state bank of india have on wednesday advised enron against terminating its ppa with mseb . mseb chairman vinay bansal , who with two other directors attended the meeting on wednesday representing maharashtra ' s 15 per cent stake in the near $ 3 - billion project , said :  the indian side told them that it would be unfortunate if enron broke the contract .  while bansal declined comment on the board decision , the sources said the indian side had expressed its interest to holds talks on the issue rather than terminating the project and there were possibilities of a fresh power purchase agreement between the company and the state . ( pti ) the economic times , friday apr 27 2001 mseb pays rs 134 cr under ' protest ' to dpc despite the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head , maharashtra state electricity board on thursday made a  protest payment  of rs 134 crore disputed amount , towards march bill of rs 146 . 64 crore to dabhol .  we were ready with the payment on wednesday itself , but dpc officials could not collect the cheque due to the statewide bandh  , a senior mseb official said .  we have disputed payment of rs 12 . 64 crore and it would be now taken up at the disputes resolution forum , of which enron india managing director k wade cline and krishna rao are members  , mseb sources said . last week , dpc had dashed off a communication to the government and mseb that it would not accept  protest payments  anymore . cline had said the energy major shall treat such payments as an election to pay the sums , which mseb in fact owed dpc in full and that the company would also not recognise the  purported protest or reservation  . mseb had paid a rs 113 . 5 crore february bill in protest last month . on april 23 last , both domestic and international lenders of dpc had met in london and held exhaustive discussions the multinational ' s move to issue a termination notice to mseb and state government . ( pti ) business standard , friday , april 27 , 001 enron india md authorised to terminate ppa the board of the enron - promoted dabhol power company ( dpc ) , at its meeting in london on wednesday , authorised the managing director of enron india to issue a notice for terminating the power purchase agreement to the maharashtra state electricity board and the state government .  the board has authorised wade cline to serve the termination notice . however , this does not mean that the termination notice will be served immediately . it is only an enabling provision and will be used only if the situation arises ,  a state government source told business standard from london . he said dpc was under pressure from its lenders . the dpc spokesperson here refused to comment on the issue . the hardening of the board ' s stand is in sharp contrast to the advice of dpc ' s lenders , who had warned enron not to precipitate matters by issuing a termination notice . the lenders had arrived at a consensus that the termination notice need not be served at this stage . serving of the notice requires a nod from the lenders , who have an exposure of about $ 2 billion in the project . sources said given the lenders ' strong opposition to termination of the contract , the enron board ' s  enabling resolution  did not have much significance beyond conveying a hardening of its stand with regard to the current imbroglio . the maharashtra chief minister had warned enron not to scuttle the process of crisis resolution by issuing a termination notice . the state government is to nominate an expert group to renegotiate the terms of the dabhol contract . enron holds 65 per cent in dpc , while us - based ge and bechtel hold 10 per cent each . the balance 15 per cent is held by mseb through a special purpose vehicle , maharashtra power development corporation . the mseb representatives were not allowed to vote at the meeting since they were an interested party . the idbi representative protested against the board ' s decision . the meeting was attended by state energy secretary vm lal . the meeting was held against the backdrop of a dispute between mseb and dpc over payment of bills . after mseb failed to pay rs 102 crore towards the december 2000 bill , dpc invoked the state government ' s guarantee and then the union government ' s counter guarantee . when payment of the rs 127 - crore january bill became overdue , dpc again invoked the state government ' s guarantee . mseb retaliated on january 28 , 2001 by slapping a rs 401 - crore penalty for non - supply of electricity at adequate levels . it demanded that dpc adjust the bills against this penalty .  this stand of mseb was explained to dpc at the board meeting  , a state government official said . the centre also supported mseb ' s stand and refused to honour the counter guarantee . the power company then invoked the political force majeure clause . a process of conciliation and arbitration between the centre and dpc is currently on . the financial express , friday , april 27 , 2001 foreign lenders slam brakes on disbursements to dpc , sanjay jog & raghu mohan global banks comfortable with enron pull - out lenders to the dabhol power company ( dpc ) are a sharply divided lot . international lenders , in direct contrast to the stand taken by local ones led by the the industrial develoment bank of india ( idbi ) , are categorical that additional assistance to dpc ' s phase - ii will be held in abeyance despite the completion of 92 per cent of the project work . the stage is also set for a preliminary termination notice to be served by dpc to the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) within the next four weeks . this follows the authorisation given to enron india ' s managing director k wade cline and dpc president & ceo neil mcgregor to serve the termination notice , and transfer notices to mseb , following wednesday ' s dpc board meeting in london . the essence of the message from the international lenders following the london meeting with dpc board is : emotions do not work . contractual obligations and payments have to be met . we are convinced that the mseb has failed to meet its obligations . there is no point in enron continuing with the project and the company should get out of it . the structuring of dpc ' s debt has created two classes of lenders . in phase - i , international lenders are covered by a sovereign guarantee while in phase - ii , no lender is . however , all lenders have a parri passu charge , making attachment of assets a messy affair . sources in international banks were quick to point out that local lenders to phase - ii of the project are worried that an awry dpc project will affect their interests more given that they have no security - other than assets - like a sovereign cover .  it was this desperation that made local lenders like idbi slash the interest rates a few months back to 16 . 5 per cent from 21 . 5 per cent ,  a leading foreign banker pointed out . three points that were made clear and stressed in no uncertain terms by international lenders were : a ) there are contractual obligations b ) mseb was not punctual in its payments to dpc and c ) mseb adopted a confrontational position by slapping a rs 401 crore rebate charge on dpc for misdeclaration and default on the availability of power . while local lenders led by idbi - with mseb parroting the same - were of the view that the current situation is a temporary one , international lenders were steadfast that pulling out of the project is the only way out . this is despite the stance taken by idbi and mseb that authorisation for termination given to mr cline and mr mcgregor was not called for . international bankers pointed out that they will now have to look at the issue of charges and protection for their loans in the event of the power project being scrapped in its present form . the points of contention are : a ) that phase - i of dpc is backed by a sovereign guarantee b ) phase - ii is not and c ) to the extent that phase - ii is covered by assets , cancellation of phase - ii may see all assets - even those under phase - i - getting attached . therefore , an examination on the segregation of assets under phase - i and phase - ii is now warranted . pti adds : in a significant move , dpc board has empowered its management to sever power supply agreement with mseb , a move that could inflict a financial liability of about rs 2840 crore on the centre . a decision to authorise dpc president neil mcgregor to issue a termination notice to mseb for sale of power was taken by the board at its meeting on wednesday . the indian express , friday , april 27 , 2001 enron : dabhol chief gets powers to end deal with the mseb the board of dabhol power company , a subsidiary of houston - based enron corp , has decided to warn the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) that it intends to pull the plug on its guhagar - based project . in a board meeting held in london on wednesday , the board decided to authorise dpc president and ceo neil mcgregor and enron india ' s managing director k wade cline to serve a ' ' preliminary ' ' termination notice for sale of power to the mseb within the next four weeks . the dabhol project has been mired in disputes since mseb began missing payments last year . mseb owes dabhol power $ 48 million for power delivered in december and january . the payment ran into a dispute after mseb slapped penalty notices of rs 401 crore on dpc for its failure to supply power within three hours of the demand being placed . but mseb has paid $ 24 million for february . and a payment of $ 31 million was made for march on thursday . the $ 3 billion dabhol project is the largest foreign investment made in india to date . issuing the preliminary termination notice could enable dabhol to suspend deliveries as it negotiates payment disputes . while a preliminary termination notice is the first of three steps that could potentially lead to the abandonment of the project by enron , analysts have described the decision as a ' ' procedural ' ' move consistent with dpc ' s negotiating strategy to recover overdue payments from the mseb . after the company issues the preliminary termination notice , step two would be an official termination notice , and step three would be a notice that the company is surrendering control of the project . if the project is terminated , the government of india will have to take a hit of $ 300 million besides paying bills of rs 1 , 500 crore for the next one year to enron as penalty . ' ' our ( centre ' s ) liability , if dabhol power project is terminated , would be one year ' s electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million , ' ' power secretary a k basu said . ' ' contractually , the centre will have to pay one year ' s electricity bill , totalling at present prices about rs 1 , 400 - 1 , 500 crore , and take over dpc ' s debt , which stands at around $ 300 million , if the project was terminated , ' ' basu said in delhi . dabhol power is in the process of completing the second phase of the 2 , 184 - megawatt power - plant project , which is 95 per cent through . while the international lenders to the project are pressurising the company to get out of the project , indian lenders , led by idbi , are asking the company to reconsider its decision on its termination notice . during the meeting in london , mseb which holds a 15 per cent stake in the project , had strongly opposed dpc ' s move to authorise cline and mcgregor to issue notices for termination . mseb chairman vinay bansal and technical director prem paunikar - both directors on the dpc board - and the state principal secretary ( energy ) vm lal , an invitee to the board , raised the issue at the board meeting in london . mseb claimed that dpc was needlessly ' ' threatening ' ' to issue various arbitration notices and thereby interpreting the clauses of ppa in isolation . in recent weeks , dabhol has raised the stakes in its spat with the mseb , delivering a notice of political force majeure to maharashtra - a step typically invoked to dissolve a contract in case of an emergency like a war , coup , or a similar radical political event . in this case , dpc ' s move was viewed as a threat to stop providing electricity . dpc has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power . critics object to the company charging rs 7 . 1 a kilowatt - hour for its power , compared with around rs 1 . 5 a kilowatt - hour charged by other suppliers . the hindu , friday , april 27 , 2001 offer of renegotiation ' too late ' : enron , by mahesh vijapurkar mumbai , april 26 . the enron - sponsored dabhol power company , which last night authorised its local management to issue a notice of termination of its power purchase agreement ( ppa ) with the maharashtra state electricity board , has decided to keep a stiff upper lip . this , in turn , has stoked speculation that the switching off of power from its phase i plant was imminent , while in reality , a lengthy procedure has to be followed as prescribed within the ppa . as one source familiar with the ppa told the hindu , ` ` it is not sudden death of the project ' ' and in all probability , the dpc , vexed with the developments , including sharp and pointed observations by the godbole committee , has chosen to only arm itself with a serious option . ` ` this would only eventually come into effect . it is not an overnight operation and a lot of legal work is involved ' ' . apparently , the dpc intends to do some arm - twisting . at the board of directors meeting in london , which maharashtra was initially disinclined to attend but later used the forum to put across its contentions on the project , the dpc squarely told the mseb nominees on the board that the offer of renegotiation had come rather ` ` too late ' ' . it also said it did not see any room for optimism about the outcome . it did not , however , rule out the option of talks , thus underscoring the possibility that the decision to authorise termination was a new weapon . the maharashtra chief minister , mr . vilasrao deshmukh , had hoped that dpc would not take any ` ` harsh step ' ' which would cause lot of damage to the interests of both the independent power producer and the government and today he expressed his dismay . in fact , the mandate of the team that went , on the strength of its stake in the dpc , was to put across the idea that negotiation was the requirement and not confrontation . echo in ls the enron issue also echoed in the lok sabha today where the power minister , mr . suresh prabhu , said that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs . 2 , 840 crores , whose liability in the project agreement was limited . the centre ' s liability in case of termination is one year ' s electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million . blow to fis the termination could prove to be a serious blow to the indian financial institutions ( fis ) which , under the leadership of the idbi , were trying to convince the other lenders of the project against the notice . the exposure of indian fis in the project is understood to be not covered by any guarantee either of the centre or the state . the times of india , friday , 27 april 2001 enron ready to pull out , but lenders say wait the dabhol power company board , which met on wednesday in london , authorised the company management to issue a termination notice to the maharashtra state electricity board . the company , however , may not pull out of the project yet , considering its lenders , who met on monday , opposed such a move and favoured renegotiations . sources present during both the meetings said that though foreign lenders supported enron on the termination issue , domestic financial institutions , led by the industrial development bank of india , prevailed over the deliberations to oppose any such drastic move . enron needs the lenders ' consent to file a pre - termination notice for pulling out from the project . the decision to empower dpc chief wade cline to issue a termination notice was taken with six votes in favour against a single idbi vote against such a move . another significant development during the entire proceedings was that the financial institutions made it clear that further funding of phase ii of the project will depend on the government of india assuring payment mechanisms . institutions are yet to disburse about 30 per cent of the sanctioned package , which is crucial for completing the phase ii expansion project . ` ` the board has given powers to wade cline to issue a pre - termination notice . but the meeting quite unanimously felt the need of the hour is not to terminate the project but to initiate serious re - negotiation proceedings , ' ' said mseb chairman vinay bansal , who attended the board meeting . ` ` mseb presented their views to the board members and it was understood by enron which also included the rs 401 crore penalty issue which is heading for arbitration proceedings . ` ` we have also made it clear that the tariff structure of enron is quite high and a downward revision of tariffs is unavoidable ,  bansal added . ` ` they cannot issue a termination notice without our consent since our exposure in the project is quite large and the lenders should approve any plans in that direction , ' ' said a top banker who was present during the lenders ' meet . ` ` there is a general consensus that the project must be completed and the proposal to terminate the ppa should be kept in abeyance , ' ' he added . the global arrangers for the dpc include anz investment bank , credit suisse first boston , abn - amro , citibank and the state bank of india , where all these parties conducted separate meetings with the company officials . however , some bankers said the company can file a termination notice even if one lender with a minimum 5 per cent exposure on the project favours such proceedings . meanwhile , in a clear reversal of roles , maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said that the state government was not keen on terminating the ppa . ` ` we will ask them to refrain from taking any such harsh steps since that would be bad news for all of us , including dpc , ' ' deshmukh said . deshmukh was echoing union power minister suresh prabhu ' s sentiments , who said that the government wanted an amicable settlement of the payment row . he , however , added that termination of the project would not hurt foreign investments , and dismissed warnings by analysts that winding up the $ 2 . 9 billion project would be a blow to india ' s efforts to woo foreign investors . the dpc has already slapped one conciliation notice on the centre and three arbitration notices on the state government over non - payment of dues amounting to rs 213 crore and interest towards the bills due for december 2000 and january 2001 . meanwhile , mseb officials said in mumbai that the march bills amounting to rs 134 crore was paid on thursday as protest payment , despite the dispute over the amount . when asked on the future course of action , bansal said it was up to the dpc . the hindu businessline , friday , april 27 , 2001 dpc board authorises md to issue ppa termination notice the board of directors of dabhol power company ( dpc ) has authorised the managing director , mr neil mcgregor , to issue the notice of intent to terminate its power purchase agreement ( ppa ) with the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) ` ` at an appropriate time ' ' . the decision was taken at a board meeting held in london yesterday . ` ` while mseb , which is an ` interested party ' , was not allowed to vote , it made a presentation clarifying its stand on the matter , ' ' a senior state government official said . the resolution to authorise the management to issue the termination notice was carried by six votes to one . idbi voted against the decision , the official said . the serving of the preliminary termination notice will lead to a six - month ` ` suspension period ' ' . according to clause 17 . 8 of the termination procedure , of the ppa : ` ` following the giving of a preliminary termination notice , the parties shall consult for a period of six months ( or such longer period as they may agree ) as to what step shall be taken with a view to mitigating the consequences of the relevant event having regard to all the circumstances . . . ' ' idbi and state bank of india , the principal indian lenders , had earlier persuaded the overseas lenders to hold their consent to the termination notice for some more time . at least one lender has to consent for the company to serve termination notice . it is understood that overseas lenders are in favour of termination of the project and are prepared to consent . however , domestic lenders are worried about the security of their advances if the ppa is abandoned mid - way . according to institutional sources , indian lenders are trying to get all the parties concerned to thrash out outstanding issues . the maharashtra and central governments too are in favour of a conciliation . mr vilasrao deshmukh , chief minister of maharashtra , yesterday went on record that the state did not want the project terminated . mr yashwant sinha , union finance minister , is also understood to be of the same opinion . ` ` the dpc will now have to decide what is the ` appropriate time ' to serve the notice , ' ' the official said . mseb pays rs 134 crore : meanwhile , mseb has paid dpc rs 134 crore towards its march 2001 bill . mseb officials confirmed that the bill was paid ` in protest ' ' today morning . ` ` they ( dpc ) had billed us for an amount of rs 146 crore . we do not agree with some of the items included , ' ' a senior mseb official said . the pioneer , friday , april 27 , 2001 enron testing maharashtra ' s nerves , t n raghunatha dabhol power company ( dpc ) has begun to put fresh pressure on the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) , the maharashtra state government and the centre for an early resolution to the prolonged dispute between them , if the dpc board of directors ' decision to authorise its managing director to serve a contract termination notice to the mseb is any indication . the dpc board , in its meeting in london on wednesday , empowered the company management to sever its power supply agreement with mseb , a move that could inflict a financial liability of rs 2 , 840 crore on the centre . the decision to authorise the dpc management to issue a termination notice to mseb was taken by a vote of six to one after the maharasthra government representatives were prevented from voting on the ground of  interested party  . when contacted , the company ' s mumbai - based spokesperson , mr jimmy mogal , declined to comment on the reports about the decision taken by the dpc board .  we have nothing to say on the reports emanating from london . we will express our views after a few days ,  he said . however , maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh on thursday termed the dpc board ' s decision as  unfortunate  .  we have already requested the company not to take any harsh decision  , mr deshmukh said in mumbai . official sources in the state energy ministry interpreted the dpc board ' s decision as a pressure tactic employed by the enron subsidiary to force the mseb to clear the pending power bills without any further delay . through its tough posture , the dpc wants to make its position stronger before it can formally agree for re - negotiations with the mseb , the centre and the state government for cutting the price of power supplied by it to the state electricity board . the sources said that the dpc ' s reported decision to authorise its managing director to stop electricity supply to the mseb did not mean that the enron subsidiary would actually go ahead with the scrapping of the power contract with the mseb .  if anything , the dpc ' s reported decision is to mount additional pressure on the mseb for clearance of pending power bills and put itself in a stronger position in settling its dispute with the mseb . as part of its plan to arm itself with powers to break a contract in case situation goes beyond its control , the dpc had recently served a political force majeure to the mseb , the centre and the state government ,  the sources said . not surprisingly , the dpc ' s london decision comes on the heels of the maharashtra government ' s decision to set up a high - level committee , comprising representatives of the mseb , the centre and the state government to re - negotiate with the enron ' s subsidiary company for reducing the cost of power supplied to the state electricity board . meanwhile , amidst the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head , the mseb on thursday made a  protest payment  of the rs 134 crore disputed amount towards march bill of rs 146 . 64 crore to dpc . riday , april 27 the telegraph , friday , april 27 , 2001 enron signal to switch off dabhol power enron today took the first decisive step out of the controversy - ridden dabhol power company when it won an authorisation from the company ' s board to stop sale of power to maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) . the meeting of the company , of which the houston - based energy giant holds 65 per cent and the mseb 15 per cent , was attended by state energy secretary v m lal and mseb technical director p paunikar and it came days after its lenders discussed payment problems and a possible termination . the centre ' s liability , if enron decides to snap the agreement , will be a year ' s power bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million . however , the company will have to wait for six months from the day it serves the notice before it pulls the plug . the centre shrugged off the move , saying there would not be any adverse effect on foreign investment in power if enron walks out .  we do not see fdi inflows into the power sector being hit ,  power minister suresh prabhu said . mseb officials said the ball is now in the court of dpc , which said its corporate policy did not allow it to comment on proceedings at board meetings . the decision coincided with a rs 134 - crore ' protest payment ' by the cash - strapped power board as part of the march bill worth rs 146 . 64 crore . there was speculation that mseb coughed up the amount to cool frayed tempers at enron ' s hub in houston , and because it was rattled by the sudden turn of events in the past few days during which the dispute had come to a head . mseb officials brushed away the allusions , saying the cheque was ready on wednesday but could not be handed over to dpc because of the state - wide bandh .  we have a disputed payment of rs 12 . 64 crore , which will be taken up at the dispute - resolution forum ,  a board official said . last week , dpc told the state government and mseb it would no longer accept protest payments in a move to fortify its legal position . mseb officials say bechtel and general electric , the other partners who hold around 20 per cent in dpc , are willing to go along with enron corp in terminating the deal but financial institutions such as idbi are not game because it puts their loans at risk . investments made by indian institutions are not covered under the centre ' s and state ' s counter - guarantees , unlike those made by international lenders . maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh called enron ' s decision unfortunate .  we had told state government officials attending the enron board meeting to stop the company from winding up its operations in the state as it will harm both parties .  the statesman , friday , april 27 , 2001 enron threatens to pull out the enron crisis deepened with the board of directors of the dabhol power company deciding to authorise the managing director , mr k wade cline , to serve a notice of termination on the contract for the first phase of the $ 2 . 9 billion power project . the decision , which could lead to the cessation of dabhol ' s power supply to the state , was taken at the meeting held yesterday in london according to reports quoting the chairman of the maharashtra state electricity board , mr vinay bansal . while dpc officials refuse to comment on anything , it is learnt that mseb was itself prepared to serve a legal notice of termination just two days before the meeting . mseb was said to have been dissuaded by the nationalist congress party president , mr sharad pawar , and union power minister mr suresh prabhu , who had talks in new delhi with the maharashtra chief minister , mr vilasrao deshmukh , and an mseb delegation last monday . the state government has been served two arbitration notices while the centre is ready to go for conciliation with the dpc for failing to honour its counter - guarantee . further , the dpc has already slapped a notice of political force majeure which protects itself against undeserved claims in the event of exigencies that force it to take an extreme step . the union power minister , mr suresh prabhu , contended in delhi that since dpc contributed only 0 . 7 per cent of the total energy output of the country , its termination would not have such a phenomenal impact on the power situation . however , if terminations proceedings go through , enron corp , a 65 per cent share - holder in the dabhol power company , would stand to net a hefty amount in damages . the union power secretary has been quoted as saying that termination of the dpc would cost the centre rs 1 , 800 crore , which is the total of one years ' electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million . according to an energy analyst , mr pradyumna kaul , the total liability would not cross rs 350 crore . however mr prabhu said in the lok sabha today that the that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs 2 , 840 crore . it is learnt that on 20 april , mr deshmukh had given the go - ahead to the mseb to prepare a legal notice to be issued to enron during the meeting of the dpc ' s board of directors on wednesday . at the meeting , the energy minister , padamsinh patil , energy secretary , mr vinay mohan lal and mseb chairman mr vinay bansal , were also present . the notice was prepared over the past weekend and taken by the delegation when they called on mr prabhu on 24 april . however , the politicians convinced them that enron would not get tough , given its huge stake in the project , and that such a notice would not be necessary . the meeting thus ended with the decision to renegotiate the power tariff , with enron ' s consent . among those present at the london meeting were mr lal , mr bansal and mseb technical director , mr p paunikar , in their capacity as directors . however , they abstained from voting since they were deemed an interested party . the only vote to go against the decision was that of the idbi which is also represented on the board , it is learnt . the chief minister , mr vilasrao deshmukh , said the state was not in favour of terminating the project . this could mean that the latest manoeuvre to arm - twist the indian authorities could achieve its immediate target of getting the arrears accumulated over the past three months cleared . the mseb owes enron rs 146 . 64 crore for march 2001 and rs 229 crore for december 2000 and january 2001 . the centre today put up a brave face on enron ' s decision saying there would not be any adverse effect on foreign investment in power sector in the country , pti reported from new delhi .  there will be no adverse impact as a result of any action by any domestic or foreign company . as far as we are concerned there will be no adverse impact on fdi in power sector ,  power minister suresh prabhu told reporters when asked about dpc ' s decision to authorise management to issue a termination notice to mseb . emphasising that there would be no fallout of such decision , prabhu said after the meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs  we are expecting cooperation from many scandinavian countries as well as european nations in the power sector .  in fact not only the power minister but also the prime minister of norway was here to inaugurate a seminar on power and he promised lot of cooperation in the sector .  mid day ' dpc may not wind up ' maharashtra chief secretary v ranganathan has said that though neil mcgregor , managing director of the dabhol power corporation ( dpc ) , has been given complete powers with regard to dpc ' s operations in the state , including the authority to wind up operations , it does not necessarily mean that mcgregor will issue such a termination notice . mcgregor was given the powers at a meeting of the dpc board in london on wednesday . ranganathan said that state officials , including maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) chairman vinay bansal and power secretary v m lal , have reported back to him about the meeting in london . with regard to the state ' s failure to pay enron , ranganathan said ,  bills are prepared as per the power purchase agreement ( ppa ) and dpc owes some money to us . our people informed enron officials about this . . in fact , there was no reason to give powers to the md to slap a termination notice .  in the london meeting , mseb and industrial development bank of india ( idbi ) representatives insisted that the dpc must pay rs 411 crore since it could not supply power whenever needed . chief minister vilasrao deshmukh has already termed as unfortunate the decision of the board of the enron - promoted dpc to give mcgregor powers to wind up operations . deshmukh added ,  we have already requested enron not to take any harsh decision .  deshmukh had earlier said ,  we have directed state government officials attending the dpc board meeting to desist the energy company from winding up operations in the state , as it would be harmful to both of us .  enron officials are keeping mum on the issue . mcgregor said ,  i am not going to give any comment .  mid day , april 27 , 2001 enron offers ' no comment ' on renegotiation , h s rao a crucial meeting of the board of directors of the dabhol power company ( dpc ) , promoted by the us energy major enron , was held here yesterday apparently to discuss fate of its $ 900 - million power project in maharashtra , but there was no official word on the indian and state governments ' decision to renegotiate the contract . an enron spokesman declined to divulge what transpired at the meeting , saying the issues discussed at the meeting were ' confidential ' .  we have not received any direct communication . unless we get it and evaluate the details , we have no comments to make ,  the spokesman said when asked about the proposed decision on re - negotiation of the project in which the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) has 15 per cent stake . asked whether the board had taken a decision on empowering dpc managing director neil mcgregor to wind up its operations in india , the spokesman said he had nothing to say on them . enron has reportedly authorised mcgregor to look at various options including selling the company ' s stake in dpc . maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said in mumbai that the state government would pay up the undisputed dues to the company . he said the maharashtra government  is not in favour of terminating the 2184 - mw project , but wanted an amicable solution to the imbroglio .  mid day , friday , april 27 , 2001 , committee to renegotiate enron deal a committee to renegotiate the power purchase agreement with the dabhol power company will be appointed by this evening , chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said today . addressing media persons after his meeting with the noted social reformer anna hazare at his official residence varsha , deshmukh said the committee would be formed by this evening or by tomorrow , at the most . he termed as unfortunate the enron board decision empowering dpc chief neil mcgregor to serve a preliminary termination notice on the maharashtra state electricity board and said the state was willing to negotiate the issue with power company .  renegotiations will be held as per the suggestions made by the godbole committee and the center will also depute its representative on the renegotiating committee . we don ' t want to take any hasty decision ,  deshmukh saidhe pointed that the only bone of contention with the dpc had been its expensive tariff and hoped that the issue would be resolved amicably . when pointed that the enron board had taken a decision to serve the notice despite state  s willingness to appoint a renegotiating committee , chief minister said it was unfortunate . earlier , in his meeting with hazare , deshmukh promised to make necessary amendments to the right to information law recently passed by the state so that the information was easily accessed by the common people . he also gave a patient hearing to hazare on his complaints of corruption in various state departments and promised action against guilty after a thorough inquiry within three months . afternoon , april 27 , 2001 ' enron ' s on ! ' state govt . to renegotiate dabhol power project , by hubert vaz the us power giant , enron power corporation ' s willingness to wrap up the dabhol power project and leave the shores may not actually materialise , though the dabhol power company chief , mr . wade cline , has been authorised to do so , since the lenders for the project would have a decisive say in the matter . disclosing this , chief minister vilasrao deshmukh confirmed this morning that the state government would churn out a compromise formula by which the power project at dabhol could be continued , and at the same time enron did not feel slighted .  enron has not yet conveyed to us about this decision . we are waiting for their letter ,  he said . when asked what sort of compromise the state government plans to forge , mr . deshmukh said ,  let our officers come back . after that we will decide a future course of action . but we are definitely going in for renegotiation of the project . it is very difficult to predict the outcome of enron ' s decision but as of now the project is still on .  when asked whether the project could be moved to another state , if wound up from maharashtra , mr . deshmukh said , that was not possible as per the terms of the agreement between the us company and the state government . however , it was difficult for the project to move out of the state itself , he indicated . he also confirmed that both parties would face considerable losses if the project was terminated . the board of directors of the dabhol power company , which met in london on wednesday , decided to put an end to all controversies surrounding the project once and for all by empowering the dpc chief to terminate the project , if he deemed it fit . however , this decision , as of now , does not necessarily indicate the death knell for the project . the enron project , which had been riddled with controversies right from its inception , had been a pretext for the political parties in the state to drag each other on the mat from time to time . the previous sena - bjp government , which had been out to terminate the project , however , chose to continue with it following renegotiations with enron ' s top visiting officials like ms . rebecca mark . and , the democratic front government inherited the controversial project when the governments changed hands a year and a half ago . meanwhile , state energy minister dr . padamsinh patil , when contacted at the osmanabad circuit house , said the state government and the central government have decided to appoint a joint committee to renegotiate the project with enron .  it is not easy for them to walk out of the project just like that . they will have to go in for litigation and this would prove costly for both sides ,  he said . in case the project is terminated , the government can still manage the power needs of the state , though it would be a bit tough job , he added .;Safe Email
582;it isn't hard at all to create your own modified version of the redhat distro. There's even a tarball[1] with this specifically in mind. The people who built the Ximian version of RedHat used a system similar to said tarball.Building a distro which uses a *BSD ports system rather than rpm, deb or whatever would complicate things a tad more IMHO.It *is* a good idea though. I've been wondering about the same thing for a couple of months now but always considered it too complicated to carry out. (If that makes any sense at all).I don't discount any other work like for example Niall's work on the B.B.C. but maybe there is general interest in an Irish distro.

584;re : hpl sale - energy operations task list sally , thanks for our meeting last week . please let me know if you don ' t think we ' ve sufficiently defined the deliverable for business ops . based on feedback from louise - you and i still may not be clearly communicating yet as to what is required . specifically , aep and enron need to agree in writing for each business ops  process  or function : 1 . who is going to carry out the business ops processes before and after close . 2 . how control over the process will be handed over from enron to aep . 3 . the necessary it actions required to put the required system functionality in place ( and who is responsible for implementing this ) . the table you developed at the end of last week ( based on bob ' s email ) moves closer to this point . as we discussed on the phone , we need to provide a description of the deliverables for each of the  systems / activities  you listed on the table and ensure that aep understands ( and signs off on ) what they are responsible for . to anne ' s point , this  sign off  can be through a memo , protocol , acknowledged email , or other . we have been having a problem in that one part of aep does not talk to the other part . so , i would like to encapsulate and elevate the individual bob hall / steve jackson discussions so that all relevant levels of aep ( and enron ) understand what is being agreed before we close . each tuesday at 4 : 00 we have a standing hpl transition coordination meeting to discuss the status of the deliverables from each group . you are welcome to attend this meeting or the separate meeting we have now established each wednesday with bob h . and tommy y . to concentrate on hpl / it / business ops matters . sally , thanks for you personal attention to this . the quicker we close the quicker bob can focus more of his time on network ' s origination efforts . regards , brian enron north america corp . from : sally beck 03 / 30 / 2001 03 : 34 pm to : louise kitchen / hou / ect @ ect , brian redmond / hou / ect @ ect cc : bob m hall / na / enron @ enron , leslie reeves / hou / ect @ ect , anne c koehler / hou / ect @ ect , anne c koehler / hou / ect @ ect subject : hpl sale - energy operations task list i talked with anne koehler in legal today to determine her understanding of what is required from energy operations prior to the effective sale of hpl . anne believes that she may have been the one to introduce the term  protocol  into these discussions . to clarify , according to anne , the  protocol  is not anticipated to be a formal legal document . instead , anne envisions simply e : mails or memos between enron and aep with regard to any sharing of information , agreements on processes to be followed in the transition , etc . operational details to be decided between enron and aep have been handled exactly in that manner to date , with e : mails being sent from bob ball ( enron ) to steve jackson ( aep ) . only critical changes to the purchase and sale agreement will be formally documented . bob hall identified the treatment of cash accounts in the original purchase and sale agreement as incorrect relative to cash flows for gas to be delivered in the month of may . he has worked with enron ' s treasury group to establish the correct procedures and has worked with sandi braband in legal to document this change to the purchase and sale agreement as an amendment to that agreement . as of today , legal has completed revisions to that amendment and anne koehler is sending it to mary perkins in enron ' s treasury group for her review . upon mary ' s review , anne will forward the amendment to aep for their review before final signatures . we devised this week a new format for incorporating the aep - hpl transition issues on which my team has been focused and have provided that to both of you . this new format incorporates the various memos and e : mails which have to date captured the status of transition issues . items that only require actions by enron will be our  to do  list . each item has a due date and we will update you weekly on progress . those items that fall under the aep list or which appear in both the enron and aep list will be the items to which we will evidence communication to aep and / or their agreement via the e : mails or memos as suggested by ann koehler . i believe that this should satisfy your requests earlier this week for written  protocol  . we will also update you weekly on the status of those e : mails and / or memos between ourselves and aep . i understand that the two of you have a regular weekly meeting for an update on the hpl sale . to provide clarity for these update meetings , may i suggest that we incorporate one of the following two approaches : 1 ) brian and i hold a regular meeting just prior to your update meeting so that brian has a full understanding of operational transition items and their status , or 2 ) i attend the first part of your update meeting in order to provide a firsthand update to the two of you . please let me know which one of these works best for you so that we can incorporate that into our schedules for next week .;Safe Email

586;uk submission of positions just to follow up on james ' s note of yesterday - my apologies for being out the elimination of the requirement to ' grab ' the fx and ir market environment from houston ( and consequently use european data ) can improve our ability to kick the overnight batch processing off earlier in the evening . james and i will be working with brian hudson to determine the timetable for effecting this change the revised batch start time would improve the opportunity to detect any system failure and complete a rerun of the valuation process so as to deliver completed results by the time the risk management team arrive at their desks in the morning . system failures are the most significant problem we face in delivering timely information to houston . consequently the probability of meeting current reporting deadlines would be greatly improved given that we will have full it overnight support covering for any it failure and curve input validation processes on trade date . indeed given the successful completion of all overnight runs we are able to deliver officialisation of all valuation systems and most spreadsheets ( david hardy is in final testing of the eastern spreadsheet feed ) by the 10 am deadline ( houston 4 am ) flash p & l by the lpm deadline ( houston 7 am ) completion of the final dpr to be submitted to houston by the 5 pm deadline ( houston 11 am ) james and i are currently finalising a document reviewing all possible changes to business processes that could improve these times . this is in addition to working with commercial and it to assess the possibility of delivering significantly faster revaluation systems that could assist in delivering a trade date control process . i can confirm that there is significant work to do in this area , however , we are dedicated to meeting the objectives of improved / more real time control . please feel free to call if the above requires any additional commentary . regards mike - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by mike jordan / lon / ect on 19 / 12 / 2000 15 : 06 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - james new 18 / 12 / 2000 09 : 10 to : rick buy / hou / ect @ ect cc : john sherriff / lon / ect @ ect , michael r brown / lon / ect @ ect , fernley dyson / lon / ect @ ect , mike jordan / lon / ect @ ect , ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect , gary hickerson / hou / ect @ ect subject : uk submission of positions rick , thanks you for your note below . we are today implementing a flash p & l process . we aim to report daily numbers at 7 am houston time and will start today with the p & l . we will build on this and hope to have draft positions and var for most books within a week or so . there will be a reconciliation of flash to final numbers which will be included in our return to houston . i will put together a note on the london dpr production process which goes into the process we currently have , the process we actually need to have , and the obstacles that are in the way . i would expect this to be finalised tomorrow . obtaining the usd interest rate curve on a more timely basis is just one of our problems but it is unfortunately by no means our only or most serious problem . james from : rick buy 15 / 12 / 2000 21 : 59 to : john sherriff / lon / ect @ ect , michael r brown / lon / ect @ ect , mike jordan / lon / ect @ ect cc : gary hickerson / hou / ect @ ect , ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect subject : uk submission of positions need your help on the following : each day we are delayed in finalising var , p & l and positions because the uk must wait for a usd interest rate curves before submitting their data to houston . i am also told that it is really not necessary to wait for this curve and the data could be submitted close of business london . even if there was some minor inaccuracy from this method it would be better than what we have now . this would greatly improve the efficiency ( by 4 to 6 hours ) in reporting to senior management . can you guys initiate this change or get me to the right person there . thanks , rick;Safe Email

605;subcategorization in tranformational grammar dear colleagues , i ' m wondering if someone could give me some pointers to the latest literature in transformational grammar ( gb , p&p , minimalism ) that deals with issues of subcategorization . in particular i would like to get a sense of the latest thinking , including ways in which minimalism departs from previous assumptions . among the questions that i would ideally like to see addressed are the following : - what kind of subcategorization relations have been assumed in the recent literature , and for what kinds of phenomena ? for instance , a transitive verb must somehow encode the requirement of taking a dp complement . but can a verb also take a pp complement according to the identity of that pp 's head ( as in _ rely _ + _ on _ ) ? - how are subcategorization relations constrained ? that is , what syntactic ( or semantic ) properties are thought to be accessible ( in the limit ) to the selecting head ? - if there are substantive formal constraints on subcategorization , where do they come from ? is there anything in the architecture of the theory from which such constraints would follow ? thanks very much , - - andreas kathol;Safe Email

( note that this is 3 days after their authority expires ) ferc will release its proposed order on 11 / 1 / 2000 based on the results of its 206 investigation of the california wholesale power markets . we don ' t know what they will find or what they will propose . the proposed order will have a 30 day comment period , after which ferc will likely issue a final order . ferc will be accepting oral comments on 11 / 9 / 2000 in washington . enron still has to determine who will provide oral comments . many companies have filed at ferc advocating or opposing a litany of price caps , cost based rates , and market redesign recommendations . it is likely that the price caps approved by the iso board will go into effect . how long they will remain in effect will depend on whether ferc extends the iso price cap authority and whether the final order stemming from the current 206 investigation stipulates a specific price cap policy . impact of price caps the attached spreadsheet contains a table of likely maximum monthly prices at different gas price levels . we think that this is the highest that markets would clear since it assumes that each hour clears at the cap . it is hard to say whether actual prices would clear significantly lower than the cap because we don ' t know whether sellers will offer below the cap or at the cap . the assumptions behind our analysis are detailed in the bullets below . take actual historical loads from 1999 and 2000 . calculate implied price cap for each hour using actual historical load , new price cap methodology , and a range of gas prices . divide historical hours into peak and off - peak buckets . calculate average price for each month for peak hours and off - peak hours . for example , we have two years worth of data for the months of january through september . each month has approximately 400 hours . for january through september , we took approximately 800 observations for each month ( 400 from each year ) and calculated a simple average of all of the individual observations . we created a peak table and an off - peak table . the table shows the calculated implied cap based off of the acutal loads at varying gas prices for each month . this value represents what the month would clear at if each hour cleared at the cap ( based on historic loads ) . while any given hour could be above this value , our calculation estimates the likely monthly average cap value ! the blue shading indicates what the caps would be given current ( 10 / 27 / 2000 nymex ) forward prices . the yellow shading indicates those forward power prices which are in excess of the proposed cap .;Safe Email

630;chechen who are the chechen ? johanna nichols university of california , berkeley author 's note : i have been doing linguistic field work on chechen and its close relative ingush for many years . though i am not an ethnographer or historian , i have tried to bring together here some general information about the chechen people and their language in order to increase public awareness of the people and their situation , and to put a human face on a people of great dignity , refinement , and courage who have paid heavily for their resistance to conquest and assimilation . this paper may be copied freely . if you disseminate it electronically or print it out yourself ( which you are welcome to do ) , reformatting ( font , spacing , etc . ) is ok but please do not edit it . johanna @ uclink . berkeley . edu fax : 510 642-6220 phone ( 510 ) 642-2979 introduction . the chechens and their western neighbors the ingush are distinct ethnic groups with distinct languages , but so closely related and so similar that it is convenient to describe them together . the term  chechen  is a russian ethnonym taken from the name of a lowlands chechen village ,  chechnya  is derived from that . ( both words are accented on the last syllable in russian . ) this term evidently entered russian from a turkic language , probably kumyk ( spoken in the northern and eastern caucasian plain ) . the chechens call themselves nokhchi ( singular nokhchuo ) . similarly ,  ingush  is not the self-designation but a russian ethnonym based on a village name , the ingush call themselves ghalghay . demography . 1989 census figures : 956 , 879 chechen , 237 , 438 ingush . the chechens are the largest north caucasian group and the second largest caucasian group ( after the georgians ) . location , settlement . the chechen and ingush lands lie just to the east of the principal road crossing the central caucasus ( via the darial pass ) , extending from the foothills and plains into alpine highlands . the lowlands enjoy fertile soil , ample rainfall , a long growing season , and a small oilfield . neighbors to the east are the various peoples of daghestan ( many of them speaking languages related to chechen ) , in the plains to the north , the turkic - speaking kumyk and ( as of the last three centuries ) russians , to the west the ingush and to their west the ossetians , who speak a language of the iranian branch of indo - european , to the south ( across the central caucasus range ) the southern ossetians and the georgians . there are two true cities in chechen and ingush territory : grozny ( pop . about 400 , 000 until 1995 ) , the modern chechen capital founded as a russian fort during the russian conquest of the caucasus , and vladikavkaz ( pop . about 300 , 000 , known as ordzhonikidze in soviet times ) in the ingush highlands at the ingush - ossetic territorial boundary , also originally a russian military fort and founded to control the darial pass . nazran in the ingush lowlands was traditionally and is now a large and important market town . the cities had substantial russian and other non - chechen - ingush population , vladikavkaz was mixed ingush and ossetic with significant numbers of russians and georgians . ( groznyj has now been destroyed and mostly depopulated by russian bombing . vladikavkaz and the adjacent ingush lands were ethnically cleansed of ingush in late 1992 . ) all russian governments - - czars , soviets , post - soviet russia - - have used various means to remove chechen and ingush population from economically important areas and to encourage settlement there by russians and russian cossacks , hence the mixed population of the cities and lowlands . language . the caucasus has been famed since antiquity for the sheer number and diversity of its languages and for the exotic grammatical structures of the language families indigenous there . this diversity testifies to millennia of generally peaceable relations among autonomous ethnic groups . chechen and ingush , together with batsbi or tsova - tush ( a moribund minority language of georgia ) make up the nakh branch of the nakh - daghestanian , or northeast caucasian , language family . there are over 30 languages in the northeast caucasian family , most of them spoken in daghestan just to the east of chechnya . the split of the nakh branch from the rest of the family took place about 5000-6000 years ago ( thus the nakh - daghestanian family is comparable in age to indo - european , the language family ancestral to english , french , russian , greek , hindi , etc . ) , though the split of chechen from ingush probably dates back only to the middle ages . the entire family is indigenous to the caucasus mountains and has no demonstrable relations to any language group either in or out of the caucasus . like most indigenous caucasian languages chechen has a wealth of consonants , including uvular and pharyngeal sounds like those of arabic and glottalized or ejective consonants like those of many native american languages , and a large vowel system somewhat resembling that of swedish or german . like its sister languages chechen has extensive inflectional morphology including a dozen nominal cases and several gender classes , and forms long and complex sentences by chaining participial clauses together . the case system is ergative , i . e . the subject of a transitive verb appears in an oblique case and the direct object is in the nominative , as is the subject of an intransitive verb ( as in basque ) , verbs take no person agreement , but some of them agree in gender with the direct object or intransitive subject . 97 % or more of the chechens claim chechen as their first language , though most also speak russian , generally quite fluently . chechen and ingush are so close to each other that with some practice a speaker of one has fair comprehension of the other , and where the two languages are in contact they are used together : a chechen addresses an ingush in chechen , the ingush replies in ingush , and communication proceeds more or less smoothly . chechen was not traditionally a written language . an orthography using the russian alphabet was created in the 1930 's and is used for various kinds of publication , although for most chechens the chief vehicle of literacy is russian . traditionally , as in most north caucasian societies , many individuals were bilingual or multilingual , using an important lowlands language ( e . g . kumyk , spoken in market towns and prestigious as its speakers were early converts to islam ) for inter-ethnic communication , any literacy was in arabic . russian has now displaced both kumyk and arabic in these functions . particularly if the chechen and ingush economies continue to be destroyed and unemployment and mass homelessness continue to undermine the social structure , there is danger that chechen and ingush will be functionally reduced to household languages and will then yield completely to russian , with concomitant loss of much of the cultural heritage . history . the chechens have evidently been in or near their present territory for some 6000 years and perhaps much longer , there is fairly seamless archeological continuity for the last 8000 years or more in central daghestan , suggesting that the nakh - daghestanian language family is long indigenous . the caucasian highlands were apparently relatively populous and prosperous in ancient times . from the late middle ages until the 19th century , a worldwide cooling phase known as the little ice age caused glacial advances and shortened growing seasons in the alpine highlands , weakening the highland economies and triggering migrations to the lowlands and abandonment of some alpine villages . this period of economic hardship coincided with the russian conquest of the caucasus which lasted from the late 1500 's to the mid - 1800 's . in all of recorded history and inferable prehistory the chechens ( and for that matter the ingush ) have never undertaken battle except in defense . the russian conquest of the caucasus was difficult and bloody , and the chechens and ingush with their extensive lowlands territory and access to the central pass were prime targets and were among the most tenacious defenders . russia destroyed lowlands villages and deported , exiled , or slaughtered civilian population , forcing capitulation of the highlands . numerous refugees migrated or were deported to various muslim countries of the middle east , and to this day there are chechen populations in jordan and turkey . since then there have been various chechen rebellions against russian and soviet power , as well as resistance to collectivization , anti-religious campaigns , and russification . in 1944 the chechens and ingush , together with the karachay - balkar , crimean tatars , and other nationalities were deported en masse to kazakhstan and siberia , losing at least one-quarter and perhaps half of their population in transit . though  rehabilitated  in 1956 and allowed to return in 1957 , they lost land , economic resources , and civil rights , since then , under both soviet and post - soviet governments , they have been the objects of ( official and unofficial ) discrimination and discriminatory public discourse . in recent years , russian media have depicted the chechen nation and / or nationality as thugs and bandits responsible for organized crime and street violence in russia . in late 1992 russian tanks and troops , sent to the north caucasus ostensibly as peacekeepers in an ethnic dispute between ingush and ossetians over traditional ingush lands politically incorporated into north ossetia after the 1944 deportation , forcibly removed the ingush population from north ossetia and destroyed the ingush villages there , there were many deaths and there are now said to be up to 60 , 000 refugees in ingushetia ( about one-quarter of the total ingush population ) . in developments reminiscent of today 's invasion of chechnya , in the weeks leading up to the action the ingush were depicted ( inaccurately ) in regional media as heavily armed and poised for a large-scale and organized attack on ossetians , and the russian military once deployed appears to have undertaken ethnic cleansing at least partly on its own initiative . ( my only sources of information for this paragraph are russian and western news reports . helsinki watch is preparing a report for publication in early 1995 . ) the invasion of chechnya presently underway has meant great human suffering for all residents of the chechen lowlands , including russians , but only the chechens are at risk of ethnic cleansing , wholesale economic ruin , and loss of linguistic and cultural heritage . religion . the chechens and ingush are sunni muslims of the hanafi school , having converted in the late 17th to early 19th centuries . islam is now , as it has been since the conversion , moderate but strongly held and a central component of the culture and the ethnic identity . economy , customs . traditionally , the lowlands chechen were grain farmers and the highlanders raised sheep . at the time of russian contact the lowlands were wealthy and produced a grain surplus , while the highlands were not self-sufficient in food and traded wool and eggs for lowlands grain . chechen social structure and ethnic identity rest on principles of family and clan honor , respect for and deference to one 's elders , hospitality , formal and dignified relations between families and clans , and courteous and formal public and private behavior . kinship and clan structure are patriarchal , but women have full social and professional equality and prospects for financial independence equivalent to those of men . academics , writers , artists , and intellectuals in general are well versed in the cultures of both the european and the islamic worlds , and the society as a whole can be said to regard both of these heritages as their own together with the indigenous north caucasian artistic and intellectual tradition . social organization . until the russian conquest the chechens were an independent nation with their own language and territory but no formal political organization . villages were autonomous , as were clans . villages had mutual defense obligations in times of war , and clans had mutual support relations that linked them into larger clan confederations ( which generally coincided with dialects ) . each clan was headed by a respected elder . there were no social classes and no differences of rank apart from those of age , kinship , and earned social honor . select bibliography anonymous . 1992 . ethnic cleansing comes to russia . the economist , november 28 , 1992 , p . 60 . blanch , lesley . 1960 . the sabres of paradise . new york : viking . comrie , bernard . 1981 . the languages of the soviet union . cambridge : cambridge university press . conquest , robert . 1970 . the nation killers : the soviet deportation of nationalities . london : macmillan . critchlow , james . 1991 .  punished peoples  of the soviet union : the continuing legacy of stalin 's deportations . helsinki watch report . new york - washington : human rights watch . friedrich , paul , and norma diamond , eds . 1994 . encyclopedia of world cultures , vol . vi : russia and eurasia / china . boston : g . k . hall & co . gamkrelidze , t . v . , and t . e . gudava .

633;http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,806579,00.htmlLioness adopts fifth antelopeRory Carroll, Africa correspondent
Tuesday October 8, 2002
The GuardianKamuniak the dysfunctional lioness has forfeited another meal by adopting
her fifth baby oryx this year, an aberration of nature which has baffled
wildlife experts.
The young lioness in the Samburu national park in northern Kenay adopted her
latest baby at the weekend, a wildlife service warden said yesterday.
Each time Kamuniak, whose name means the blessed one in the local Samburu
tongue, has tried to protect the antelopes from other predators and allowed
the natural mothers to feed them.
Unfortunately for her, one oryx ended up in the belly of a male lion while
Kamuniak slept, the others were either rescued by wardens or retrieved by
their natural mothers.
The wardens think the latest adoptee, nicknamed Naisimari (taken by
force), was adopted at the weekend.
She must have adopted her on Sunday because they are in harmony, said
Gabriel Lepariyo, a warden.
Naisimari's natural mother has been seen shadowing the odd couple at a
distance.
Theories to explain the phenonemon abound: not having her own cubs, Kamuniak
is lonely, she is colour-blind and short-sighted and thinks the calves are
cubs, the oryx were too frail to flee, breaking the classic prey behaviour
and confusing the hunter, Kamuniak wants to be a vegetarian, Kamuniak wants
to be loved. ------------------------ Yahoo! Groups Sponsor ---------------------~-->

Ah.  Neither Ted nor I were particularly up to date.  I pulled 
down the lates from CVS and am now running with it.  I miss the 
blue ftoc lines but I'll sort that out soon, iirc Chris said 
it's a simple resource change.Ted's code to ketchup made use of some of the procs that went 
away in the sequence generalization.  I've fixed it up... almost 
and it looks like this now:proc Cabeen_Mark2CurSeen {} {
    global exmh mhProfile msg

         }
    }
    busy Seq_Del $exmh(folder) $mhProfile(unseen-sequence) $results

The almost is because it's not updating the highlighting on 
the ftoc.  I'm too tired to go figure out how to fix that just 
now and have to move on to other stuff.  If someone wants to 
forward me a clue feel free.Now that I've got all of Chris' sequence stuff I discovered that 
my sequences are ... cluttered.--Hal

643;ny event w / pec & keyspan louise , it is my understanding that you have represented discomfort in signing the ny event expenditure approval form . i appreciate that a  holiday event  or spending any amount on customer entertainment seems counter to what we all are staying awake at night contemplating about our future . however , on our trip in ny we received positive feedback from keyspan ( even with the current events disclosed ) on a jv structure and the interest to leverage a midwest to northeast structure . we described that the ny event this year would be only between pec and keyspan and they immediately placed the date on their calendars . since the meeting they have each confirmed ( chuck , ed & mike ) of their attendance . please remember $ 15 , 000 of this event is already fixed sunk cost and the incremental amount represents roughly $ 19 , 000 . i am continuing to work with dori to decrease the remaining amount . i would appreciate your consideration of providing the approval . if not , i need to un - invite pec and keyspan asap . dori needs to act immediately to firm the numbers represented with each of the vendors . thanx , laura;Safe Email

Date: Not suppliedI received some feedback in email (from several of you actually) regarding my 
earlier blog about the Parents Television Council[1], which recently published 
a report in which they labeled Buffy as the worst show on television for 
children. Let me clarify why this organization bothers me so much.Buffy as a show is clearly inappropriate for children under 12, and a game like 
GTA3 is as well. The PTC, however, has a clear agenda that goes beyond simply 
warning parents about the dangers of television shows or video games. There is 
a belief on the part of the PTC that the hour from 8-9pm (the first hour of 
primetime) must be designated a family hour, and that no offensive shows should 
air during that time. I don't believe that it's the networks' responsibility to 
restrict the kind of content aired during a particular hour of television. The 
shows that air during primetime run the gamut, some are family-oriented and 
some aren't. There is, however, no shortage of suitable content should parents 
and children wish to watch TV together during this hour.It should be the parent's responsibility to police a child's television 
viewing. If you don't want your kids watching _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_, then 
don't let them, but don't campaign to have the show removed from the air or 
shoved into a late hour that would only result in its cancellation just because 
you don't like its content. If you don't think a show is appropriate, don't let 
your kids watch it.The PTC also seems to find shows offensive that are family-oriented. An example 
of one such show is _Malcolm in the Middle_. I would hardly call this show 
inappropriate for kids. Apparently the only shows that the PTC deems 
appropriate are those that have been sanitized to match their 
ultra-conservative agenda. Even then, I wouldn't really mind, but the idea that 
all other shows must be relegated to some later hour is just ludicrous.[1] http://www.parentstv.org/

and does so. Why you can't do this after you have one library already
installed is beyond me.Kate--

by
John SterneThe launch last month of a marketing special interest group by the
Irish Linux Users Group (ILUG)  -  open source and marketing, it
seems, might not be mutually exclusive concepts  -  has already
sparked an interesting initiative at University College Cork.  When
the new academic year begins at UCC, every incoming student will
be offered a copy of Red Hat Linux 7.3.ILUG member Braun Brelin proposed this promotion, when he ran a
training class for staff at the UCC computer science department.
Brelin, who is the director of technology at OpenApp, says that the
Linux offer could be extended to any or all of the other Irish
universities.The user group is tapping into an international Red Hat programme
that aims to introduce students at all levels to the open source
style of computing.  The Linux distributor runs an 'educational
channel' to reach this audience, bundling educational software
with its operating environment and offering networked support
services to eligible applicants.  This scheme was originally designed
to suit the educational structures in the US, but is now available to
schools and universities throughout the world.Red Hat Linux 7.3 incorporates ease of use and maintenance
features and is intended to counter objections that Linux is hard to
master on personal systems.The Linux-for-all project at UCC could also raise the profile of Red
Hat Ireland.  Based in Cork, this operation has run shared financial
services for other Red Hat offices in Europe since 2000.  Until now
its involvement with users in Ireland has been fairly limited,
although it does sometimes refer them to other Red Hat offices in
Europe that offer consulting or technical support services.David Owens, Red Hat's director of global logistics and production,
sees the formation of the ILUG marketing group as a reason to take
a more proactive approach.  In the last three months, he notes, his
office in Cork has received more and more calls from Irish
companies that are interested in adopting Linux and has introduced
some to Red Hat pre-sales consultants.
-------------
Many thanks are due to Braun and David for working together on this one.Regards

simply fax your check to : 808-878 - 6869 so do n't hesitate , call today this offer is for a limited time only ! what is express mail server ? express mail server ( ems ) bulk e-mail software is the only thing that works . ems transforms your computer into a personal mail server . with no additional hardware , ems software will give you complete control of your mailings , because the mail you send will originate from your computer and be delivered directly into the mailbox of your recipient . since the mail originates from your computer , it is no longer necessary to use your internet service provider 's mail server . when you use the previous generation stealth or cloaking type programs , they work by uploading your mail to your provider 's mail server . they can also be programmed to send mail through other providers mail servers without authorization ( this is considered theft of service ) . the problem is , the previous generation stealth type programs upload the messages faster than these mail servers can process them . many times this causes a provider 's mail server to bog down and crash . obviously , this will make providers furious with you . furthermore , you may think that you are sending hundreds of thousands of messages , unfortunately , most of it simply gets filtered and deleted by the mail server . you are lucky to get 10 % - 20 % of that mail delivered . with ems software your computer emulates a mail server and you actually control and watch all your mail being delivered piece by piece . there is a 100 % delivery rate with this program anywhere on the internet . we did say 100 % delivery rate to any internet email addresses . a bold claim but it is true . this is the latest technical advance in bulk email since the advent of the stealth type programs . this program verifies domains and validity of email addresses before sending mail . this dramatically reduces your bounced back undeliverables . bounced back undeliverables can sure bog down a server . you can also control where you want any bounced back mail to go . it can go to any email address you want with ems . ems can work with any dial up internet account , ( aol is not considered a dial up internet account ) an isdn line or a t - 1 or t - 3 . it runs on windows 95 or nt . we have not heard of any person losing a dial up account with this software . one reason bulk email is so frowned upon with numerous isp 's ( internet service providers ) is people try to send as much mail as they can , as quick as they can and crash the mail server of the isp . this won't happen with ems software since you do n't since you do n't use the mail server of the isp to send your mail . the program actually sends the mail directly from your computer , which is now , a bona fide mail server , to the recipients mail server avoiding any potential blocks that would prevent you from reaching those on your mailing list . you do not have to  forge  headers or randomize anything to have 100 % of your mail delivered , although the program does allow for randomization and customizing of headers . you can send mail omitting the  to   from  and  reply to  portions of your headers . want to send out your messages in color . this is not a problem with ems . just select a font color with your mouse , and then click on a background color as well . want to make your font bold or put it into italics , just point and click . want your message centered or shifted left or right , once again just point and click . unlike all of the others , ( which are all the same , but go by different names ) this software is very straightforward and easy to use . if you can log on to aol , you already know more about computers than you 'd need to use ems . we also provide technical support by phone to answer any questions you may have . ems works with any windows 95 or nt computer . it requires no additional hardware or software . the ems software sends at speeds up to 80 , 000 messages per hour delivered using a modest pentium and a 28 . 8 modem . rates will dramatically increase with an isdn or cable modem and of course with a t - 1 they will be even faster . if you want to take advantage of this breakthrough in bulk email technology give us a call on the number below . we do n't plan on repeat mailings for this product so take advantage of this opportunity . the cost to you is $ 275 . 00 ! money well spent if you consider that you can buy stealth ( or the many others like it . . . they all operate the same way ) for $ 400 . you might be happy with stealth if you do n't mind frequent loss of dial-up accounts , and lot of complaints . not getting a lot of your mail delivered due to blocks and crashed mail servers deleting your mail , along with the resulting low response rate from your mailings , all of which defeated the purpose of e-mailing in the first place ! few people are aware of this new technology , so you are already leaps and bounds ahead of any competition . using this , you can sell anything you wish , over and over . also , consider that you may decide to offer a mailing service to others . you ' ve probably gotten e-mails that claim they can send your advertisement e-mail for a cost of $ 200 per 100 , 000 . what most people do n't realize is that only 20 or 30 of the mail they pay these people to get sent actually gets delivered ! this mailing service is very profitable , and using this software , you can advertise that service to millions for free ! we also have cd roms with 60 million addresses to help you start . with your purchase , visit our web site at : http : / / 138 . 27 . 44 . 5 . cearth . on . ca / users / imc call i . m . c at : phone : ( 808 ) 876-1550 fax : ( 808 ) 878-6869 and place your order today while supplies last and we ' ll be happy to send you a demo copy and answer any questions you may have . or call us and we will give you our full service web site addresses to be removed from our mailing list or to be added to our  global remove list  simply go to : http : / / www . ctct . com all remove requests are respectfully immediately;Phishing Email

664;california update 4 / 27 / 01 the following report contains confidential and sensitive information . please treat with discretion . executive summary : ? ferc price cap decision reflects bush political and economic objectives . politically , bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on davis , from an economic perspective , he is unwilling to create disincentives for new power generation ? davis finds four major flaws with ferc plan , most notably its exclusion of out - of - state generators ? june lst  kill clause  for ferc order could coincide with new bush regional plan ? california facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade , expected $ 20 billion power bill this summer - - economic crisis would force deeper administration involvement ? qf bid for advance payments from pg & e likely to fail in bankruptcy court ? new generation delays probable because of state / qf squabbling ? consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to socal bailout deal 1 . ferc fallout the ferc decision is a holding move by the bush administration that looks like action , but is not . rather , it allows the situation in california to continue to develop virtually unabated . the political strategy appears to allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where davis cannot escape shouldering the blame . once they are politically inoculated , the administration can begin to look at regional solutions . moreover , the administration has already made explicit ( and will certainly restate in the forthcoming cheney commission report ) its opposition to stronger price caps on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the construction of new generation . it is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were generally happy with the ferc order and that the only ferc commissioner who favors price caps actually voted against this plan . 2 . something less than effective price caps from davis ' s point of view , the ferc plan has four major flaws : ? the order applies only to california , not to the rest of the west . non - california generators are not required to sell at capped rates to california . ? as the order is written , it is more of a price floor for emergency power than a ceiling . ? state officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game the system , because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a stage 2 emergency and does not require any collusion . ? even when the price caps kick in , they are based on the cost - plus for the highest cost producer supplying power to california and do not require wholesalers to abide by the cap . the generators can also charge above the cap , provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to ferc . 3 . proposal  kill clause  adds to the political dilemma for davis the ferc proposal includes a  kill clause  that says the caps will be withdrawn unless california ' s iso agrees by june lst to become part of the regional grid now under ferc control . if davis doesn ' t sign on to the regional grid by june lst , then he will have to live with june 2 nd headlines blaming him for letting the  bush price caps plan  collapse . 4 . growing fiscal risk in california sources speculate that california could therefore pay as much as $ 20 billion on power this summer - this is more than the combined enterprise value of pg & e and sce . these sources believe that , because of the severity of the situation , the ferc and / or the federal government will be forced to take further action to control prices for power . the consensus is that the state of california will run out of money in about 90 days . one of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to finance new power plant construction in exchange for long - term power deals . the bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge loans they are providing to california . the bush administration and the fed are only now waking up to the seriousness of the fiscal picture . the country ' s largest and most prosperous state will have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating deficits in a matter of months . 5 . qfs to seek advance payment from pg & e meanwhile , on the bankruptcy front , the qfs reportedly will ask the bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from pge ' s accounts , since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment for gas . it appears very unlikely that the qfs ' request will be granted . if the qfs do not receive advance payment , it is likely that most of the 4 , 000 mw of gas - fired qf capacity will remain offline . 6 delays likely in new qf generation the qf deals made with the state for long - term contracts are being continually renegotiated , which is likely to mean that the new plants those contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as anticipated . 7 . consumer groups ready to challenge constitutionality of sce bailout plan harvey rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an analysis of the mou for the sce bailout plan . the analysis was done by a utilities analyst , rather than a lawyer , though it appears to raise a number of good legal points . for example , one of the elements of the mou is a  non - bypassable  charge on ratepayers that would require them to pay even if they disconnect from the grid . this is effectively a tax , since there is no exchange of value for money , which under the ca constitution cannot be used to directly benefit a private entity . this makes the bonds that would be issued are general obligation bonds , rather than revenue bonds . according to the constitution , the state cannot be put into debt to benefit a private company . for this and other reasons , even if the republicans would vote for the sce bailout , which remains unlikely , the bailout probably would not stand a likely constitutional challenge . 8 . governor hurt by continued failure to disclose long - term power contracts the issue of the governor ' s failure to disclose the details of the long - term power contracts continues to distress the other players in the crisis . even if he were to disclose everything he and his staff have been negotiating , it is likely that their actions and negotiations will challenged , creating an even further delay .;Safe Email

671;linguistic theory dominique sportiche , partitions and atoms of clause structure subjects , agreement , case and clitics this collection builds on the theory of principles and parameters and its economy - - minimalist descendants . the essays progressively develop a view of syntactic structures in which syntactic properties are increasingly analyzed as atomized in progressively smaller elementary components and partitioned in the way these elementary components are represented . dominique sportiche argues that as a consequence of this view , languages do not differ at all in their syntactic organization . routledge leading linguists routledge : 1998 : 448 pp cl : 0 415 16926 7 : # d4946 : $ 110 . 00 laura a . michaelis , aspectual grammar and past time reference this work examines the linguistic constructions which speakers use to talk about events that occurred in the past and states which held in the past . laura michaelis argues that the fundamental conceptual division between events and states forms the basis of systems of verbal aspect in all languages , and that one cannot talk about the meaning of a past-tense assertion without making reference to the event-state distinction . focusing on english data , the author examines the semantic and functional overlap between assertions about the past and assertions involving events : when one asserts that an event of a given kind exists , one is making an assertion about the past . this semantic overlap can be evoked as a way of characterizing the close relationship between the past-tense construction and the past-perfect construction : while a past tense assertion like she left is used to describe the past , a present-perfect assertion like she has left is used to assert the existence of an event by invoking its aftermath ( her absence ) . dr . michaelis argues that the two constructions are semantically equivalent , but distinguished by their function in narrative . this study presents a semantic framework for analyzing all aspectual constructions in terms of the event-state distinction , and describes the grammatical expression of aspectual meaning in terms of a theory of grammatical constructions . in this theory , grammatical constructions , like words , are conventionalized form-meaning pairs , which are best described not only with respect to their intrinsic semantic values , but also with respect to the functional opposition in which they participate . michaelis argues that many of the otherwise puzzling grammatical constraints which characterize the english present-perfect construction can be motivated in terms of the functional opposition between present perfect and past tense . routledge studies in germanic linguistics 4 routledge : 1998 : 320 pp cl : 0 415 15678 5 : # d4385 : $ 90 . 00 asa kasher , ed , pragmatics 6 volume set the purpose of this collection is to portray the development of pragmatics as a science of language , in a such a way as to enable readers to critically assess this theorectical development . issues explored include * presupposition * implicature * discourse * grammar * communication * indexicals * psychology * sociology . this work provides highly useful references and suggestions for further reading , and has an exceptionally detailed subject and name index to enable easy and immediate access for the reader . critical concepts routledge : 1998 : 2653 pp cl : 0 415 11734 8 : # d2960 : $ 905 . 00 for more information on these and other titles from : routledge london * new york in north america : www . routledge-ny . com elsewhere : www . routledge . com;Safe Email

probably be the best format for use with Plucker/SiteScooper, depending
on how good the DOC --> HTML conversion is.  i haven't used either in

for it's light-weight size, but OpenOffice has the better DOC importer.)don't know which of these are better or worse than the other, but i

PalmOS-friendly as you can get.  never tried/needed it, but it's listed
there in the Save As dialog box.Wine (or CrossOver Office, if you already have it) may support Word
Viewer (free download from Microsoft), but didn't a year or so ago when
i last tried.  Word Viewer is what i used back in the day to convert
Word 97 docs to Word 95, as you could display the Word 97 doc and copy &
paste the text (with formatting) into Word 95, which was the only
version of Word that i had.  anyways, a little nostalgia.> > I don't have a Windows machine, so it becomes problematic to convert them,

significant other and for burning multi-session cd-r/rw.  (is there any
linux gui app that supports cdrecord's multi-session feature?)  since
OpenOffice, i've been able to edit Word docs flawlessly (or at least the
simple Word documents i receive from others).anyways...

tweaking, or commenting of some more broken/high-FP-ing rules.What do you all think?  are we ready to go?  anyone run into any trouble

Kragen, do you know of any?I personally have FoRK delivered to an address (napier%waste.org)
that has SpamAssassin enabled, agressively, where it just nukes
anything it thinks is spam. Usually I figure if I miss a FoRK post,
no big deal, I'll pick it up by the replies if it's interesting.For personal mail (joe%barrera.org) I either don't use SpamAssassin,
or use it but where it just flags messages instead of nuking them.
So if someone is sending a message just to me, I'll get it even
if it looks like spam.So in other words, Rohit, if you had sent to joe%barrera.org, I
guess I would have received it in a timely fashion.So where's all that booze? When's the retry?

Date: Not suppliedA new KPMG study concludes that the RIAA and its member companies are hurting 
themselves by focusing on cracking down on P2P sharing instead of figuring out 
ways to earn a living with it.     Media companies must put less emphasis on protecting digital content and 
    instead find ways to make money from digital music and movies if they hope 
    to beat back copyright pirates who threaten their businesses, according to 
    a study released on Wednesday from KPMG...     They complain about the Napsters, she said, referring to the bankrupt 
    music swap site that was found to violate U.S. copyright laws. But why do 
    the Napsters exist, because the marketplace wants them.     Steel said that if the issue is not on boardroom table ... then that 
    boardroom has problems.  Link[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Michael!_)[1] http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&ncid=581&e=3&cid=581&u=/nm/20020925/tc_nm/media_kpmg_dc

713;hey i have a problem:
i have a rpms that i have installed that i want to uninstall, i do it
like so:
rpm -e [rpm package]
and it gives the error: package not installed, so i install it like
so:
rpm -i [rpm package]
and it gives the error: package already installed, so i force it to
install like so:
rpm -i --force [rpm package]
this installs it and then i try to uninstall it again and it still
gives me the same error: package not installed.
 
How can i get it to recognize that the package is indeed installed it,
and/or get it to unstall it?
 
Thanx in advance,
Brian French-French

Last week, when indexing stuff for WhoisIreland.com, I noticed that
ns0.domainregistry.ie and banba.domainregistry.ie were out of synch by a
few days. The other nameservers seemed to give a current SOA at that
time. However the affected secondaries may have been using
ns0.domainregistry.ie for axfr and propagated the error.This whole thing does seriously bring into question IEDR's decision to
outsource the technical admininstration of .ie to a company that
apparently does not even admin its own DNS.  It is a nice story though -
almost as good as the time that .ie disappeared for 8 hours in July
1998.Regards...jmcc

730;Hi,when testing spamassassin, i found a little problem but
I don't know if it's spamassassin or my pop3-server
that caused it.Pop3-servers seem to expect a blank line before From -lines
to seperate mails in a mailbox-file.
Spamassassin does not add such a blank line before
mails delivered directly to mailbox.
Result is that the pop3-server (tested with qpopper4 and
cucipop) delivers some mails glued together.I think the solution is to write a blank line to the mailbox
befor spamassassin adds the filtered mail.Please tell me if you're not the right man for this,
 if i'm totally wrong or if you're sure, the pop3-server
 shouldn't insist on a blank line before From -lines.Thank you.PS: Mailserver ist postfix-1.1.11Regards,--

lately I've got the feeling that exmh is getting slower and slower. I 
just decided to check that vs. reality, and yes, speed has left the 
scene somewhere between the release of 2.5 and now.I checked on a number of small messages in a big folder (~10000 
msgs). The delay of the Next button has increased considerably:2.5-release: 350-450 msec
latest cvs: 1000-12000 msecFrankly I think this is getting close to non-acceptable since the 
user settings hasn't changed.Anybody have any ideas where performance disappeared?/Anders_______________________________________________

746;Dear Sir/Ma, 
I am HAJIYA MARYAM ABACHA, wife of the late Nigeria Head of State,General Sanni Abacha who died on the 8th of June, 1998 while still on active duty. l am contacting you in view of the fact that we will be of great assistance to each other likeness developing a cordial relationship. I currently have within my reach the sum of THIRTY FIVE MILLION US Dollars (US$35,000,000.00) cash which l intend to use for investment, like Real Estate Development or import/export business specifically in your country. This money came as a payback contract deal between my late husband and a Russian Firm on our countries multi-billion dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant Project. The Russian Partners returned my husband's share of USD$35,000,000.00 after the death of my husband and lodged in my husband's security company of which l am director right now, the new Civilian Government have intensified their probe on my husband's financial and oil company. In view of these, l acted fast to withdraw the US$3!
 5,000,000.00 from the company's vault and deposited in another private security company vault within the country. I have since declared the Security Company bankrupt. No record ever existed concerning the money traceable by the government because there is no documentation showing that we received the money from the Russian. Due to the current situation in the country concerning government attitude towards my family, it has become quite impossible for me to make use of this money within. Let me refer you to the front page of This Day Newspapers of 10th March 2001. You can check it through their website : www.thisdayonline.com , click on archives,8th. june, 2001) The present government in Nigeria had frozen and seized all my bank accounts both here in Nigeria and abroad. Thus consent l shall expect you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss in detail about this transaction. Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to transfer this fund, l proposed a percentage of 3!
 0% of the total sum to you for the expected service and assistance, 10
% for offsetting minor expenses incurred in the course of this transaction. Your urgent response is highly needed as to stop further contacts. All correspondence must be by the email address above. l must use this opportunity to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily confidential whatever your decision while await your prompt response. NB: Because of the security being mounted on the members of my family, l have decided that this transaction be kept in utmost secrecy, remember to include your private Telephone or fax number for easy communication. You can also contact my trusted friend and family attorney,Barrister Aishat Gidado at aishatgidado@go.com or her number 248033044180.
Best Regards.

In my most recent column for The Wall Street Journal Online (now available on GigaLaw.com at http://www.gigalaw.com/articles/2002/isenberg-2002-08.html), I examine the potential greater effect of this lawsuit. For example: Terence Ross of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, the news publishers' attorney, even told me that he thinks Internet users who configure their browsers to disable graphics (a common tactic to boost the speed of Web surfing) are committing copyright infringement because they are interfering with Web publishers' exclusive right to control how their pages are displayed.Doug Isenberg, Esq.

rpms for the rar-3.00 file archiving/unarchiving program. This is
distributed as a binary tarball only, and I repackaged it based
originally on an earlier version of rar I found on the net, just for
practice. It also makes use of subpackages, and I was both proud of
myself for getting it to work, and sickened that I repackaged
binary-only crap. Enjoy.--

difficult case are those whose back-end business
can be executed entirely in a foreign nation, such
as the 419 spammers. And you're right: there's not
much we can do about those, except filter them in
various ways. But the vast majority of spammers
have a back-end business that requires a native
presence. Debt consolidation. Mortgages. Herbalife
and other MLMs. Even porn sites require credit
card transactions. That means the people responsible
CAN be found.>I don't know of any law that specifically /exempts/ them from lawsuits, 
>it's just that no one has yet succeeded in any important way.There have been some successful suits, but (a) it
takes too much effort, and (b) the result isn't enough
to deter the spammer. But you're talking about action
constrained by law. In an anarchy, people act more
directly, with less cost, and to more effect. Spammers
very quickly would learn their lesson. Except for the
ones who ply their scam in a foreign country.Of course, that's assuming there are ISPs and other
infrastructure in an anarchy. Arguing about how things
would work without the state involves a large degree
of counterfactual reasoning.>no lawmaker has ever been even a tenth the catalyst on improving the 
>quality of life in Britain and the western world as did central heating and 
>the invention of one A.J.Crapper.Hmm. I've lived most of my life in houses that did
not have central heating, including my current abode.
As to the crapper, it did not do nearly as much to
improve waste management in cities as did the public
sewers which it feeds, and the water lines that supply
it. Without these, you would find that a chamber pot
works just as well.

resting-place on a shelf in a supermarket in Denver. My legs should be
arriving in Moscow any time now. All my feathers have been processed and are
now being eaten by cattle somewhere in Texas. My blood and bones have been
rendered for cat food, fertilizer and who-knows- what else. My wings have
been seasoned with barbecue sauce and served with a side of ranch dressing
and celery at some bar and grill in New York City. My feet? Well, they're
headed to Asia where I'm told they're something of a delicacy.-----------So, a couple of things intrigued me about this byline, and its associated

788;My name is Jeremy Lessaris. I'm looking for investment properties in the Midwest. The issue I've been having is that not every everyone deals with the properties I'm looking for. You know the houses that you are almost sure will not sell, maybe they're really ugly or need a lot of work or are in a bad neighborhood. But for what ever reason, the houses just don't sell.I need those houses...Most of the agents I've dealt with were hesitant because there isn't much of a return for what time and effort you invest. However, the private investors I work with use unconventional private funding so we both can avoid long drawn out loan approvals. In fact most cases we just pay cash and close in a week. I am pre-qualified with Greentree Funding for up to $900,000 for a purchase money mortgage based on a non-owner occupied loan at 90% LTV.  (And of course you get your full commission.) I'm not a licensed real estate agent nor am I affiliated with any real estate firm, which means I can work with you just about any way you want. Please don't be under the impression that we have to pay under market value to be interested. Sometimes I can even pay retail price. The only guarantee I'll make is that I will not waste your time, and in most cases I can tell you over the phone whether I'm interested or not. If you are looking to purchace a project home from our inventory or would like information on forming an alliance with  Synteligent Properties, please contact me @ 847.366.4300 or email me @ jeremy@synteligent.com Best Wishes,

I'll give it another go tonight, maybe come back with some error messages.Just to clarify for those who didn't understand me initially - I have a
floppy drive installed, but it doesn't physically work. There's nowhere
handy to pick one up where I am, and I don't fancy waiting a few days for
one to arrive from Peats.Thanks for the answers,

803;competitive analysis update # 18 - us terrorism attacks political / security update : headlines ? taliban to declare  jihad  against the us if afghanistan targeted , heightening expectations for retaliatory attacks against us targets . ? bush stokes unease among allies and international press with call for bin ladin to be brought to the u . s . ,  dead or alive .  ? taliban offers to deliver bin ladin to a third country , likely a muslim country . offer almost certain to be rejected by bush administration . ? fbi arrests five additional suspected hijackers , raising expectations for further attacks ? u . s . officials to meet with saudi foreign minister in washington , questions to be asked about involvement of sons of saudi diplomat in attacks analysis ? efforts by the bush administration to build a multilateral coalition against terrorism will have to address two key foreign policy issues : iraq and the israel - palestinian peace process . missteps in either area could weaken the emerging multilateral coalition against terrorism and have important implications for the oil market . ? for a multilateral approach to work in the long term , the administration will need to provide countries with incentives to cooperate in the anti - terrorism campaign , especially in places such as the moderate arab states where dismantling the networks suspected of supporting terrorist groups will involve moving against internal targets . moreover , the administration will need to deal with the root causes that provide willing cadres to extremist groups , especially economic problems and political disenfranchisement . dealing with all of these factors will necessitate us financial support as well as greater us imagination in dealing with lingering regional issues . policy towards iraq . ? washington appears to be resisting attempts to broaden its attacks to include iraq at this point , despite internal and external pressure for such action . this will be a leading indicator , assuming that no firm proof of baghdad ' s involvement in the bombings is uncovered . a more aggressive us approach towards iraq has seemed likely since july when moscow blocked the introduction of  smart sanctions  during the last rollover of the oil - for - food program . ? however , given regional sensitivities in the arab world to washington ' s iraq policy and the interests that states such as russia and to a lesser extent china have in the country , the bush administration cannot have both a genuinely multilateral approach to anti - terrorism and an unilateral hard - line iraqi policy . it will need to chose between one or the other . israeli - palestinian peace process . ? without an equitable solution to this conflict , most experts believe that the bush team ' s anti - terrorism coalition is doomed to failure . ? initially , at least , the signs are not good : the sharon government in israel has been resistant to us pressure to rein in its aggressive policies towards the palestinians ? washington ' s willingness to confront israel on this issue will give a clue to its willingness to stay the anti - terrorism course and hold its broad coalition together . market update : us equities : ? next 48 hours seen as critical after yesterday ' s losses and fed cut . 8750 on dow seen as key resistance point : looking for decisive close below 8750 , not just intra - day test . downside risk seen to 7500 if the 8750 area doesn ' t hold : 7500 key b / c it was the nadir of asian crisis . ? two wildcards : company warnings : will the torrent continue ? ( slight positive coming out of oracle ) , war : issue remains scope , duration . asia overnight : ? bank of japan , with little headline opportunities to ease , but after much speculation and criticism did cut its discount rate 15 bps to . 1 % from . 25 % late in tokyo today . the nikkei closed up 175 . 47 . europe : ? equities : european markets are down ( as of 0630 cdt ) uniformly around 2 % but most of the losses were at the opening with stability since . ? currencies : us $ steady in european trading with marginal gains against most currencies . there may be uncertainty about the $ but conversations over the last two days uniformly confirm that there is no renewed confidence in the euro . the swiss franc continues to be the biggest beneficiary of the crisis . ? central banking : the bank of england mpc decided to cut this afternoon , but only 25 bps : less and later than expected . the monthly inflation numbers complicated the picture with a higher than expected rise , rising + . 4 % in aug and now + 2 . 6 % annual , rising above government target of + 2 . 5 % for the first time in 28 months . ? european airlines : mirroring american counterparts ' woes in today ' s trading : klm issued a profit warning , virgin cut jobs , alitalia appealed for government assistance , all airlines are off in trading , though not as badly as in us infrastructure nuclear power ? delegates from 132 nations opened the annual international atomic energy agency conference monday with calls for tighter security - and admissions that little can be done to shield a nuclear power plant from an airborne assault . ? the architects of the world ' s nuclear plants designed them more with ground vehicle - not airborne - attacks in mind . ? the buildings that house nuclear reactors themselves are far smaller targets than the pentagon posed , and it would be extremely difficult for a terrorist to mount a direct hit at an angle that could unleash a catastrophic chain of events ? u . s . experts are proposing the installation of anti - aircraft weaponry manned by military personnel who would be stationed outside the nation ' s 104 commercial reactors airlines attorney general john ashcroft assigns federal agents to domestic commercial flights , said law enforcement officers believe there is a continuing threat because  associates of the hijackers that have ties to terrorist organizations may be a continuing presence in the united states . ;Safe Email

827;Thank you for your interest!Judgment Courses offers an extensive training
course in How to Collect MoneyJudgmentsIf you are like many people, you are not even sure what a
Money Judgment is and why processing Money Judgments
can earn you very substantial income .If you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you
will have a Money Judgment against them.You are happy you won but you will soon find out the
shocking fact: Its now up to you to collect on the
Judgment. The court does not require the loser to pay you.
The court will not even help you. You must trace the loser
down, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts,
real estate, stocks and bonds, etc.Very few people know how to find these assets or what to do
when they are found. The result is that millions of
Judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten.In 79% of the cases the winner of a Judgment never sees a
dime.The non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic
proportions. Right now in the United States there is
between 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollectedMoney
Judgment debt . For every Judgment that is paid, 5more
Judgments take its place.We identified this massive market 8 years ago and have
actively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented this
business. We have perfected it into a well proven and solid
profession in which only a select few will be trained in the
techniques necessary to succeed.With our first hand experience we have built a course which
teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown
and exciting field of processing Money Judgments.By following the steps laid out in our course and with
reasonable effort you can become very successful in the
processing of Money Judgments.The income potential is substantial in this profession. We
have associates who have taken our course and are now
working full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per
year. Part time associates are earning between $24,000.00
and $100,000.00 per year . Some choose to operateout of
their home and work by themselves. Others build a sizable
organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business
offices.Today our company and our associates have over 126
million dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently
processing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form
of joint ventures between our firm and our associates.
Joint ventures are where we make our money. We only break
even when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin on
the reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting
capability is so extensive that government agencies, police
officers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us
for reports.
Many of our associates already have real estate liens in
force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars.
Legally this means that when the properties are sold or
refinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10%
interest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments.
Annual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to
$500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the
payment of the principal.Our associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per
year. This is just for interest, not counting principle
and not counting the compounding of the interest which can
add substantial additional income. Typically companies are
sold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interest
an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell
their business for approximately 2.5 million dollars.92% of all of our associates work out of their home, 43%
are women and 36% are part time .One of the benefits of working in this field is that you are
not under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off
for a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you are
working on will be there when you return. The Judgments
are still in force, they do not disappear.The way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your
computer and telephone to do most of the processing. You
never confront the debtor. The debtor doesn't know who you
are. You are not a collection agency.Simply stated the steps to successful Money Processing
are as follows:Mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals
with Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out who
to write to)8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you
and ask for your help. They call you, you don't call them
unless you want to.You send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to
sign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and
50% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for
$2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.You then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor
and their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports to
assist you. They range from credit reports from all three
credit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment
locates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.
The prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to
1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge
$6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other
companies charge $25.00.Once you find the debtor and their assets you file
garnishments and liens on the assets you have located.
(Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the
course)When you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to
the original Judgment holder.Once the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of
Judgment to the court. (Included in the course)Quote's from several of our students:Thomas in area code 516 writes us: I just wanted to drop
you a short note thanking you for your excellent course. My
first week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars .Your
professionalism in both the manual and your support.  
You have the video opened doors for me in the future. 
There's no stopping me now. Recently Thomas states 
he has over $8,500,000 worth of judgments he is working onAfter only having this course for four months, Larry S. in
area code 314 stated to us: I am now making $2,000.00 per
week and expect this to grow to twice this amountwithin the
next year. I am having a ball. I have over $250,000 in
judgments I am collecting on nowAfter having our course for 7 months Larry S. in 314 stated
I am now making $12,000.00 per month and have approximately
$500,000.00 in judgments I am collecting on. Looks like I
will have to hire someone to help outMarshal in area code 407 states to us I feel bad, you only
charged me $259.00 for this course and it is a goldmine. I
have added 3 full time people to help me after only having
your course for 5 months>From the above information and actual results you can see
why we can state the following:With our course you can own your own successful business.
A business which earns you substantial income now and one
which could be sold in 3-5 years, paying you enough to
retire on and travel the world. A business which is
extremely interesting to be in. A Business in which every
day is new and exciting.None of your days will be hum-drum. Your brain is
Challenged. A business, which protects you from Corporate
Downsizing. A business which you can start part time from
your home and later, if you so desire, you can work in full
time. A business, which is your ticket to freedom from
others telling you what to do. A business, which lets you
control your own destiny. Our training has made this happen
for many others already. Make it happen for you!If the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you
to talk to a real live human being, no cost or obligation
on your part.Please call us at 1-281-500-4018.We have Service Support staff available to you from 8:00am to
10:00pm (Central Time) 7 days a week . If you callthis number
you can talk to one of our experienced Customer Support personnel.
They can answer any questions you may have - with no obligation.
Sometimes we run special pricing on our courses and combinations
of courses. When you call our Customer Support line they can let
you know of any specials we may be running. If you like what you
read and hear about our courses, then the Customer Support person
can work with you to place your order. We are very low key. We
merely give you the facts and you can then decide if you want to
work with us or not.Thank you for your time and interest.+++++

1. Turns of Phrase: Beanpole family
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Historically, families have usually had more children than parents,
resulting in family trees that looked like pyramids. However, in
recent years, especially in countries like Britain and the US, the
number of children per generation has steadily gone down, while
life span has increased. This has led to a shape of family tree
that some researchers have likened to a beanpole - tall and thin,
with few people in each generation. The term beanpole family has
been around in the academic literature at least since 1987, but it
rarely appears elsewhere. A recent British report has brought it to
wider public notice, at least in the UK. Some researchers find it
too slangy and prefer the jargon term verticalised to describe
such families. Whatever term you prefer, specialists are sure that
the demographic shift is having a big effect on personal
relationships within the family and (for example) the role of
grandparents.The rising divorce rate partly explains the growth of the
'beanpole' family. With almost one in two marriages ending in
divorce, many adults have at least two families, each with a single
child.
                                             [Observer, May 2002]Noting the rising number of so-called 'beanpole' families in
Britain (families with only one child), the report warns that a
child without siblings 'is starved of the companionship of family
members of their own age ... [leading to] greater social isolation,
with teenagers adopting a more selfish attitude to life'.
                                            [Guardian, June 2002]
2. Weird Words: Jobbernowl
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A stupid person, a blockhead.Unfortunately, this useful and effective insult has rather dropped
out of use in these mealy-mouthed times. The last excursion for it
that I can find is in the classic W C Fields film The Bank Dick
of 1940, in which the word occurs in a variant form in the line:
Surely, don't be a luddie-duddie, don't be a moon-calf, don't be a
jabbernow, you're not those, are you?. Before that, it turns up in
one of the novels of Hall Caine in 1890, but even by then it seems
to have been rather rare.It's from the old French jobard, from jobe, silly. That word
was then added to noll, the top or crown of the head, the noddle.
The first sense was of a block-like or stupid-looking head, but was
soon extended to refer to the quality of the mind within.
Jobbernowlism is the condition or state of being a jobbernowl,
or an act or remark that is especially stupid.Careful how you use it: the recipient might be a subscriber!
3. Beyond Words
-------------------------------------------------------------------
I've been away at a heritage conference in Colchester these past
few days. On my way back, my eye was caught by this warning sign
posted above some steps at the local railway station:   Caution
   Do not run on the stairs
   Use the hand rail
4. Q&A
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. For my job I have to read American magazines concerning consumer
electronics, home systems, burglar alarms, etc. I very often come
across the expression bells and whistles, which seem to relate to
equipment, accessories or features that are offered to the customer
as plusses but are not really indispensable for the device to work.
Is that right? And where does that funny phrase come from? [Herve
Castelain, France]Q. You're right about the meaning of this phrase, which refers to
gimmicks - non-essential but often engaging features added to a
piece of technical equipment or a computer program to make it seem
more superficially attractive without enhancing its main function.The phrase is actually quite modern and may be a product of the
American military. At least, one of its earliest appearances was in
an article in Atlantic in October 1982, which said it was
Pentagon slang for extravagant frills. There's some evidence that
the term has actually been around since the 1960s, but the early
evidence is sparse.Where it comes from is still a matter of learned debate. A literal
sense of the phrase appeared around the middle of the nineteenth
century, referring to streetcars, railways and steamships. Before
modern electronics, there were really only two ways to make a loud
warning noise - you either rang a bell or tooted a whistle. Steam
made the latter a real power in the land (anybody who has heard the
noisy out-of-tune calliope on the steamboat Natchez at New Orleans
will agree about its power, though less so about its glory). And at
one time clang, clang, clang went the trolley in large numbers of
American cities.At least some early US railroad locomotives had both bells and
whistles, as this extract from an article in Appleton's Journal
of 1876 shows:  You look up at an angle of sixty degrees and see sweeping
  along the edge of a precipice, two-thirds up the rocky
  height, a train of red-and-yellow railway-cars, drawn by
  two wood-burning engines, the sound of whose bells and
  whistles seems like the small diversions of very little
  children, so diminished are they by the distance.Could it be that to have both bells and whistles was thought
excessive, a case of belt and braces, an unnecessary feature, a
frill?Possibly. But it's more probable the slang sense of the term comes
from that close musical relative of the calliope, the theatre
organ. Extraordinary instruments such as the Mighty Wurlitzer
augmented their basic repertoire by all sorts of sound effects to
help the organist accompany silent films, among them car horns,
sirens, and bird whistles. These effects were called toys, and
organs often had toy counters with 20 or more noisemakers on
them, including various bells and whistles. In the 1950s, decades
after the talkies came in, but while theatre organs were still
common in big movie houses, these fun features must have been
considered no longer essential to the function of the organ but
mere fripperies, inessential add-ons.It's possible the slang sense grew out of that. It got taken up
especially by the computing industry, perhaps because opportunities
to add them are so great.                        -----------Q. The designation of robes for academic dress clearly comes from
its origin with the clergy in the Middle Ages. But what about
mortarboards? The best I could find was its origin in the 12th or
13th century clergy cap, but that was not square-shaped. Does
mortarboard refer to the guilds or is its origin more ancient?A. The academic cap often called a mortarboard is quite ancient,
but that word for it only dates from the middle of the nineteenth
century (a less slangy way to identify it is to call it a
square). The literal mortar board is the wooden plate, usually
with a handle underneath, on which bricklayers carry small amounts
of mortar. A similar tool is used by plasterers, but they usually
call it a hawk.What seems to have happened is that the similarity in shape between
the brickie's board and the academic cap led some wag, probably at
Oxford University, to apply the name of the one to the other. Our
first recorded use is in a book of 1853-6, The Adventures of Mr.
Verdant Green, an Oxford Freshman by a clergyman named Edward
Bradley, who wrote under the pen name of Cuthbert Bede (the names
of the two patron saints of Durham, where he went to school).
Verdant Green is a sort of undergraduate Pickwick and the book
recounts his adventures. This magisterial reprimand by a don
appears after one such escapade: I will overlook your offence in
assuming that portion of the academical attire, to which you gave
the offensive epithet of 'mortar-board', more especially, as you
acted at the suggestion and bidding of those who ought to have
known better.After a slow start, the book became a huge success, selling more
than 200,000 copies in the next 20 years. Whether Mr Bradley
invented the slang term we may never know, but his book certainly
popularised it.                        -----------Q. I got into a discussion about chip off the old block with
friends, and we are wondering if it had to do with sculpting,
jewelry making, woodworking, or none of the above. What does this
term mean, and where did it come from? [Vijay Renganathan]A. The associations are with carpentry, and the block is definitely
made of wood.The first form of the expression was chip of the same block,
meaning that a person or thing was made of the same stuff as
somebody or something else, so from the same source or parentage.
An early example is in a sermon by Dr Robert Sanderson (at one time
Bishop of Lincoln), dated 1637: Am not I a child of the same Adam
... a chip of the same block, with him?.Later that century, another form is recorded a chip of the old
block, which meant that somebody was the spitting image of his
father, or continued some family characteristic. At some point,
probably late in the nineteenth century, this was modified to a
chip off the old block, which does nothing to change the sense,
but is the way it's now usually written or said.

831;sum : quantification about four weeks ago , in linguist 8 . 948 , i asked a question on behalf of the basque language academy 's grammar commission about the standard or recommended scope of  quantifier  and  quantification  as grammatical terms , with special reference to the function of  so many  and  so  in sentences like : there were so many students that we needed a larger classroom . the students were so intelligent that we needed to get another teacher . i wished to know whether it is considered terminologically appropriate to say that not only  many  and  so many  but also  very  and  so  quantify , and thus that the function of all of these ( including what i call degree modifiers ) is quantification . better to contextualize the terminological problem that motivated the question in the first place and to help clarify the following report / discussion , let me suggest , ad hoc , calling the two positions contemplated the  quantifiers versus degree modifiers  position and the  quantifiers subsuming degree modifiers  position respectively , or for short , the versus position and the subsuming position . it is also only honest for me to declare at this point that my personal position has always been and continues to be that of the versus view , although i tried to word the original question neutrally . at this point i perhaps ought to note that several respondents seem to prefer to treat  so many ( students )  and  so ( intelligent )  as merely various occurrences of a single item  so  rather than treating _ so many _ as an  item  to be discussed in its own right . i view this as a manifestation of linguistic anglocentrism : unlike english , in many languages  so many  is not expressed by the item equivalent to english  so  plus a quantifier equivalent to english  many  , and since i was not particularly asking about english in my question , i reject the assumption that the english lexical composition of  so many  is of crucial relevance to the issue i raised . thanks to the following who responded to my question : bruce d . despain , patricia galea , e . h . klein - v . d . laaken , jan k . lindstrom , p . l . peterson and marilyn n . silva . a summary of their answers and suggestions follows , with an interjection of my own personal opinion at times , identified by my initials ark . marilyn silva supports the versus position , stating that  quantifiers determine noun phrases , not adjectives .  for  very  and  so  she prefers the term  intensifier  to my proposed  degree modifier  . patricia galea expresses the same views . ( [ ark : ] since my original question was not about the latter terms , i shall refrain from defending my preference of  degree modifier  over  intensifier  in this context , larry trask 's _ dictionary of grammatical terms in linguistics _ treats the two terms as interchangeble . ) marilyn silva also discussed what i called  consecutive  sentences , pointing out that the subordinate clauses in the two english examples cited above ,  . . . that we needed a larger classroom  and  . . . that we needed to get another teacher  , are called  adverbial clauses of extent  in her treatment of english grammar , _ grammar in many voices _ ( ntc pub . group , 1995 ) . she considers that here  it is the clause that seems to quantify , not the intensifier in the main clause  . silva went on to point out that english clauses of extent can be licensed by a main clause containing _ so _ ( with or without _ many _ ) , as above , but also by one containing _ such _ , as in : george was such a gentleman that he never raised his voice . and draws our attention to the fact that _ such _ could hardly be called a quantifier . ( [ ark : ] this argument seems to be of general typological interest , independently of the fact that there is no real equivalent of this use of _ such _ in basque . ) in all these sentences with extent clauses , silva argues ,  it is the [ subordinate ] clause that seems to quantify , not the intensifier in the main clause . . . which merely licenses the subordinate clause .  according to silva , then , _ so _ and _ such _ should not be lumped together with items like _ many _ or _ very _ in any case , in line with the view that they do not themselves quantify but merely license a subordinate clause which quantifies . looking beyond english , jan lindstrom pointed out that in swedish a single lexical item , _ mycket _ , functions both as a quantifier ( of nouns ) meaning  much  and as a degree modifier or intensifier of adjectives meaning  very  , providing the following examples : 1 ) da  r fanns mycket folk . ' there was much people ' 2 ) hon a  r mycket intelligent . ' she is very intelligent ' lindstrom does not seem to be defending a particular terminological usage in providing this observation , but merely wishes to offer useful information that may be of interest in the discussion . [ ark : ] it seems to me that while the interest of this sort of observation is undeniable , it does not obviate the need for a terminological distinction , nor does it justify the subsumes position , but rather illustrates the need for linguists to employ a clear meta-language to enable us to distinguish between items or uses even where , as here , their formal expressions overlap language-specifically . ( by the way , some other instances of the use of a single form for  very  and  much  include portuguese _ muito _ , catalan _ molt _ , and italian _ molto _ , but i can think of many more languages that do not show this kind of overlap or homonymy . ) philip peterson wrote discussing in somewhat more abstract terms the actual semantics of terms like  many  and  more  , and referred me to his article  complexly fractionated syllogistic quantifiers  ( journal of philosophical logic , 1991 , 20 , 287-313 ) . bruce despain 's comments are oriented to language-specific issues of syntactic classification of quantifiers in english that are not likely to be relevant to a description of basque , for which reason i shall not report his suggestions here . henny klein brought to my attention the following bibliographical reference : gary , e . ( 1979 ) extent in english . a unified account of degree and quantity . phd thesis , university of california , los angeles . in summary , none of those who responded favoured the subsuming position according to which  very  and  so  can be referred to as quantifiers or their function as quantification ( unless that was what jan lindstrom wished to imply , it is my understanding that it was not ) . four of the six answers do not actually lean one way or the other . the two answers that address my question directly and suggest an answer , those of silva and galea , both constitute votes for the versus position . eskerrik asko denoi ( many thanks to all ) alan r . king , ph . d . alanking @ bigfoot . com alternative email addresses : mccay @ redestb . es , a @ eirelink . com , 70244 . 1674 @ compuserve . com snail : orkolaga plaza 3 1a , 20800 zarautz , basque country , spain phone : + 34-43 - 134125 / fax : + 34-43 - 130396 visit my web page at - - > http : / / www . eirelink . com / alanking /;Safe Email

Date: 2002-10-08T01:21:33-06:00DeCSS detractors have repeatedly claimed that DeCSS needs to be stopped because 
it makes perfect digital copies of DVDs possible. Recently, in private email, 
Ernest Miller claimed that doing so would be a violation of the DMCA. In this 
in-depth special report, I show that using perfectly legal, (I assume) 
licensed, off-the-shelf consumer software, copying DVDs is easy and in many 
ways encouraged. *Tools:*
1 PowerBook G4 with slot-loading DVD drive (any model should work)
1 Monsters, Inc. Collector's Edition DVD (any DVD should work)
1 copy of Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar *Process:*
1. Insert DVD into drive. Notice how Jaguar helpfully loads the DVD Player for 
you.
2. Open the DVD (it appears on the desktop) and drag the VIDEO_TS folder to 
your hard drive. Ejct the DVD.
3. In DVD Player, select Open VIDEO_TS Folder... from the File menu. Use the 
dialog that appears to select the VIDEO_TS folder on your hard drive. Now the DVD plays just like it would were the DVD in the drive. By extension, I 
could also put the DVD up on my site for you to download and watch. I could 
share it via a P2P network. And I haven't done anything to decrypt the DVD or 
violate the DMCA: I've used only basic tools available to all normal computer 
users on my (I assume) fully-licensed consumer laptop. *Disclaimer:* Seth Schoen, whose opinion I highly respect on these matters, 
finds it unlikely that the DVD was CSS-encrypted if this was possible. I am not 
sure how to verify if the DVD is CSS-encrypted. If someone has a suggestion, 
please let me know. However, if it is true, then it's very interesting that 
Disney has released such a major movie without encryption.;Safe Email

Date: Not suppliedI just finished reading an article about Mozilla[1] for Salon.com[2]. This 
excerpt was rather amusing._It is a good question, because in almost every way, Mozilla is a better 
browser than Navigator. For example, Netscape's best new feature, tabbed 
browsing -- which lets you have several Web pages open in the same browser 
window, and allows you to bookmark all the pages under one name -- was in 
Mozilla many months ago, and the Mozilla project that created it (called 
MultiZilla) already has an improved version available. When asked about this, 
Yecies, of Netscape, said, That's true, but the engineer who's working on it 
[for Mozilla] is a Netscape employee. It was always done with the intention of 
fostering general browsing usability for Netscape. 
_
Yes, ok, I suppose that's true if by Netscape employee you really meant 
Apple employee. and by always done with the intention of fostering general 
browsing usability for Netscape you meant was done in a weekend for Mozilla 
because I thought MultiZilla was cool. Here's how the whole tabbed browsing thing happened. One night I finally 
downloaded an extension called MultiZilla (go check it out on mozdev.org[3]. I 
was particularly impressed with a feature contained in MultiZilla called tabbed 
browsing. I started doing research and discovered NetCaptor[4], a tabbed 
browser that embedded WinIE. MultiZilla was cool but at the time suffered from two fundamental flaws that 
prevented the code from being incorporated into the Mozilla tree. The first was 
a UI flaw, namely that at the time it had ripped off NetCaptor down to the last 
context menu item. The GUI was similar enough that there would have been 
definite concerns about so obviously copying some of NetCaptor's more obscure 
capabilities (like sticky names and tab locking). The second concern was that 
the tab behavior wasn't encapsulated cleanly into a widget. I produced a simplified version of tabbed browsing on my own time (did it in a 
weekend) that removed some of the geekier NetCaptor features and that 
encapsulated the tab behavior so that the changes to other Navigator files 
would be minimal. Once I established that it didn't degrade performance in the 
single tab case, I checked it in as an experiment.The response was overwhelming, as were the bugs that started being filed. So 
much so that at first I wanted to back tabbed browsing out of the tree. I was 
overruled by Mozilla, which turned out to be a good thing for all I think. :) 
Even with all the excitement and hoopla surrounding the advent of tabbed 
browsing on the engineering side (and in the Mozilla community), Netscape still 
didn't get it. Netscape marketing prioritized all sorts of useless work that 
nobody had even started above tabbed browsing in their marketing document. They 
continued to do so for months, simply not getting it. It was this odd curiosity 
that one of their engineers had checked in, and they didn't know what to make 
of it.Only after the press raved about it did Netscape really jump on board. I'm sure 
Netscape is doing the same thing now with popup blocking. Can't you just see it 
now? We'll have a Popup Manager, and a Manager to manage the Popup Manager, and 
twenty-seven preferences for fine-grained control of all aspects of popups. Can you believe how disfunctional Netscape is? When their engineers say you 
should do this or you should do that, they get completely ignored (or blown 
off), but when CNet says We didn't like this, or we didn't like that., 
Netscape scurries to meet their demands. That is simply pathetic.[1] http://archive.salon.com/tech/feature/2002/09/10/browser_wars/

as a criminal, not celebrated in word and song.But you knew that.When a Palestinian sets out, to great rejoicing, to attempt to target
children with a homicide-bomb, they are careful to dip the shrapnel in

the CPU is executing it. I.E. there is more logic
executed (including NIC logic) when going down
to the metal than when using lo. So how much
logic is involved for each type of IPC (why
are you limiting yourself to sockets? there are
mutexes, shared mem, files, messages...). Anyway the
best IPC method to choose is dictated by the data
you want to communicate between the processes,
as the various IPC mechanisms are tuned for
various data types.IBM are running a series comparing doze and Linux IPC mechanisms.

847;possible temporary move of hpl to 1201 louisiana i finished the walk through of the 15 th floor space located at 1201 louisiana this afternoon . on the walk through with me were paul foust ( facilities ) , robert humlicek , jeffrey vincent and andrew hawthorn . i previously talked with deborah bubenko and vincent fox about this space . comments from the review are as follows : most of the floor is composed of offices with some large group areas ( conference rooms etc . ) included . the floor can accommodate up to 150 people . however , with this amount of people in the area , space will be very tight . almost all offices will need to hold at least two people . large offices will need to hold three or four . the larger areas will need to have cubicles installed to make complete use of the space . with maximum doubling up in the offices , you might fit a couple of conference rooms on the floor with one kitchen area . there are nooks just off some of the hallways that would accommodate several network printers . as tommy stated in his earlier e - mail on the allen center space , the fire code will require us to put a strobe in each office with multiple occupants . one area of concern is the amount of furniture currently on the floor . the floor plan shows approximately 90 desks on the floor . some offices were locked so we could not verify the total . however , this number appears correct . also , for the most part , there were only desks in the offices unless they were occupied . chairs , filing cabinets , credenzas , etc . would needed to be added to this space . we need to determine where the additional furniture will come from . there is one large area with 11 cubicles forming a circle . according to paul , this was the area where telephones were answered for the previous tenant . this might work for the trading area . the room appears to have the most telephone connectivity , is open , and would accommodate up to 11 . if we decide trader telephones are necessary ( record conversations etc . ) , the cost associated with the purchase of the equipment and the necessary installation time will need to be factored into our schedule . the floor has two data closets . at least one of the closets has 24 hour air conditioning according to vincent . this floor has the same server connectivity at the three allen center space . a 100 meg single mode fiber connection serves this space . robert has informed me that the floor currently has switches to support up to 200 ports . however , this does not mean that the drops to all offices are complete . probably some cabling will need to be added . it appears that the space can accommodate up to 150 users even with the extra ports needed for network printers , laptops , etc . however , if we need to accommodate more than 200 ports , additional switches can be added . in summary , the floor space at 1201 louisiana looks as good or better than the space that was being considered at three allen center . russell s . long enron net works , llc russell . long @ enron . com ( 713 ) 345 - 3754;Safe Email

863;california update 3 / 15 / 01 executive summary ? davis might concede to rate hikes for future power consumption but not for past utility debt ? davis and pg & e negotiations at a standstill , sticking point is net short for pg & e this summer ? as the days go on with no word of a secured deal , involuntary bankruptcy chances increase significantly among small generators and qfs ? ferc would probably approve transmission deal but with several conditions for california california public utility commission rate increases today may be the turning point as the ca puc reviews the size of the department of water resources ( dwr ) rate increase to be passed along to consumers on their electricity bills . until now , davis has considered rate hikes to be political suicide , but there may be some relief for him from consumer groups . sources indicate that one of california ' s main consumer advocate leaders may tolerate rate increases for future power consumption , but remains adamant about not raising rates to cover past utility debt . dwr , which is currently buying power on behalf of the state , needs more income to securitize the planned $ 10 b bond issue that is key part of davis ' plan to sign long term power contracts . as dwr continues to spend $ 40 to $ 60 m every day on power purchases , a well placed source informed us the dwr is essentially bankrupt . it currently has no money for normal activities such as ordering supplies , purchasing new equipment , etc . the department of finance is forwarding dwr money from where ever it can ( parks , other programs ) to purchase power , but dwr ' s hands are tied until revenue bonds are issued . the california state treasurer phil angelides will be submitting a recommendation on rate increases in order to secure revenue and cover $ 10 billion worth of state bonds . davis & pg & e at odds sources report that davis and pg & e negotiations are facing two difficult challenges : 1 ) pg & e wants 2 . 9 times book , which is far more than consumer groups recommend for the sale of its transmission lines ( sce accepted 2 . 3 ) , and 2 ) pg & e needs relief from davis for pg & es legal responsibility to be the ultimate power purchaser for the state , and at this point davis wants to limit further state energy power purchases ( especially for summer ) . the utilities refuse to sign a deal which will leave them billions of dollars further in the red ( $ 3 to $ 4 b ) and pg a measure that if accomplished would provide davis with even less negotiating power . with all this activity , davis is starting to lose support in the state legislature . sources report increasing tension between the governor and state senate president pro - tem john burton . burton has just announced a special senate committee will investigate the generators for evidence of price manipulation , and the state auditor is also planning an investigation . davis increasingly realizes he has to protect any deal he signs against being picked apart by the legislature and consumer groups later . qf ' s most likely source of involuntary bankruptcy sacramento insiders fear that a group of small generators will lose patience and force bankruptcy on the utilities . sb 47 x may have been california ' s qualified facilities last hope at avoiding an involuntary bankruptcy filing against pg & e , socal ed , and sdg & e . the bill designed to cut the qf ' s costs and provide them with a better rate structure is being held up in the state ' s senate . sources indicate that a filing could come at anytime and further investigations are underway to ferret out the most likely candidates . out with hebert , in with wood the bush administration favors replacing hebert , jr . with texas puc head pat wood . there is an intense battle behind the scenes between senate republican leader trent lott , who favors hebert , and president bush , who wants wood . the administration would prefer wood because they do not want ferc to pick a fight with davis which means bush might ultimately lose some western states in 2004 . in effort to tone down the recent press reports , hebert has made several token concessions to california , including $ 69 million worth of power refunds and streamlining the federal permitting process for pipeline and power plant installation . it ' s is expected that ferc would most likely approve any transmission deal that davis could complete but with a list of conditions . some conditions might include bring the lines formally into the regional grid system as well as other elements to pave the way for more dramatic administrative actions in the west next year . the bush administration is opposed to price caps and believes in free market solutions . the administration is also considering whether it might be a good idea to privatize federally - owned assets such as bpa .;Safe Email

873;The material appended below comes from Martin Gardner's
book _Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science_ -- revised
and expanded edition published in 1957 by Dover Publications,
Inc. (New York City).Bill Bennetta
_________________________________________________[M]ost pseudo-scientists have a number of characteristics in
common.        First and most important of these traits is that cranks work
in almost total isolation . . . in the sense of having no fruitful
contacts with fellow researchers. . . . The modern crank insists
that his isolation is not desired on his part.  It is due, he claims,
to the prejudice of established scientific groups against new
ideas. . . .        The modern pseudo-scientist . . . stands entirely outside
the closely integrated channels through which new ideas are
introduced and evaluated.  He works in isolation.  He does not
send his findings to the recognized journals, or if he does, they
are rejected for reasons which in the vast majority of cases
are excellent.  In most cases, the crank is not well enough
informed to write a paper with even a surface resemblance
to a significant study.  As a consequence, he finds himself
excluded the journals and societies, and almost universally
ignored by the competent workers in his field.  In fact, the
reputable scientist does not even know of the crank's
existence unless his work is given widespread publicity through
non-academic channels, or unless the scientist makes a hobby
of collecting crank literature.  The eccentric is forced, therefore,
to tread a lonely way.  He speaks before organizations he
himself has founded, contributes to journals he himself may
edit, and -- until recently -- publishes books only when he
or his followers can raise sufficient funds to have them printed
privately.        A second characteristic of the pseudo scientist, which
greatly strengthens his isolation, is a tendency toward
paranoia. . . .        There are five ways in which the sincere pseudo-
scientist's paranoid tendencies are likely to be exhibited.        (1) He considers himself a genius.        (2) He regards his colleagues, without exception, as
ignorant blockheads.  Everyone is out of step except himself.
Frequently he insults his opponents by accusing them of
stupidity, dishonesty, or other base motives.  If they ignore
him, he takes this to mean his arguments are unanswerable.
If they retaliate in kind, this strengthens his delusion that he
is battling scoundrels. . . .        (3) He believes himself unjustly persecuted and discriminated
against. . . .        (4) He has a strong compulsion to focus his attacks on the
greatest scientists and the best established theories.  When
Newton was the outstanding name in physics, eccentric works
in that science were violently anti Newton.  Today, with
Einstein the father symbol of authority, a crank theory of
physics is likely to attack Einstein in the name of Newton. . . .        (5) He often has a tendency to write in a complex
jargon, in many cases making use of terms and phrases he
himself has coined. . . .

   That's something that POSIX would do - make every platform as
   equally broken, rather than standing up and saying how about
   we try & make everyone better. eh?  POSIX doesn't do anything.  POSIX is a de jour
 specification for a voluntary minimal implementation to
 encourage software transportability.  no-one, absolutely
 no-one, has or ever had to implement POSIX or be restricted
 to POSIX.  commercial considerations et.al. may encourage
 some POSIX-compatibility, but that's a freely-made choice. IMHO, the process's weakness is a general rule --- which
 has been ignored on occasion --- to only consider formal
 submissions of proven technologies.  that translates into
 specifying more-or-less common parts of the existing *ix
 implementations which actively contribute to the process.
 most of the committees are loath to blue-sky, solicit
 proposals/research, or pick an uncommon or unsponsored
 implementation, even when manifestly superior.  (IMHO,
 this is why POSIX is *ix and not, e.g., Plan9 or Inferno.) OTOH, considering the motivating force behind the process,
 it can be argued the above weakness is a strength ....   (why? Because in the real world, you can't. Somethings just suck) yep.  which is not to say POSIX sucks per se.  but the old
 pre-POSIX *ix world arguably did, at least in terms of ease
 of software porting.  one of *ix's claims to fame is it is
 perhaps the first system where one could seriously consider
 porting, more or less intact and with relative ease, software
 from one architecture+platform+vendor to a radically utterly
 different triple. however, as people discovered, there's a lot of difference
 between consider porting and actually porting --- and
 some problems were silly.  some were self-inflicted (e.g.,
 assuming byte-orientation or a particular endianness), but
 others were Frustrating system incompatibilities --- the
 motivating force that lead to /usr/group, XPG (X/Open), POSIX,
 Spec1170, Unix98, Common Unix, &tc.     Â«The nice thing about standards is there's so many to

890;>See Jared Diamond's excellent Guns, Germs, and Steel for the story.Yeah, I know the party line.  The evidence for it is extremely meagre.
New Worlders had two entire continents and tens of millions of people,
which is a plenty big enough reservoir for infectious diseases to thrive
in.  Their records show that they were plagued with them long before 1492.Take Ireland in the early 1800s.  Assume a population of circa 8
million.  Take Ireland around 1900.  Assume a population not much
above 3 million.  Ignore natural variations between mortality and
natality.  Omit emigration.  Observe the Great Famine in the middle.
Deduce that it killed 5 million (actually about 1).  Transpose to 16th
century Mexico.  Grossly inflate estimates of pre-contact population,
because nobody has a damn clue what it was anyway.  Underestimate
later population levels.  Deduce that 10's of millions died.  Lather,
rinse, repeat.R

			      June, 2002In this issue:* Progress of Senate anti-spam bill
* European Union bans spamIF YOU DON'T KNOW WHY YOU GOT THIS MESSAGE: Please see the
About This Message section at the end.- --------------------------------------------------------------* Progress of Senate anti-spam billOver a year ago, Sen. Conrad Burns (R-MT) introduced S.630, the CAN
SPAM Act of 2001. This bill would require UCE to have a valid return
address to facilitate consumers' removal from spam lists. It would
place enforcement in the hands of the Federal Trade Commission, and
state Attorneys General. It would also permit Internet Service
Providers (ISPs) to enforce violations, up to $10 per illegal spam.
It would preempt any stricter state anti-spam laws.The Senate Commerce Committee considered the bill on May 17th, and
reported it out largely unchanged.  It's not now scheduled for further
action in the Senate.CAUCE has always opposed this bill, since we believe it would lead to
more spam, not less.  When South Korea passed a similar opt-out law
last year, spam from Korea soon increased by a factor of 10.Our April 2001 press release goes into more detail about the problems
with S.630: http://www.cauce.org/pressreleases/pr-s630.shtmlWe're pleased that the Congress is looking at spam issues again, and
hope that in the future we can help them create an effective bill that
the entire Internet community can support.- --------------------------------------------------------------* European Union bans spamGLOBAL INTERNET COMMUNITY APPLAUDS EUROPEAN ANTI-SPAM VOTEMay 31, 2002 - The Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial E-Mail
(CAUCE), EuroCAUCE, CAUCE India, CAUCE Canada and the Coalition Against
Unsolicited Bulk E-Mail, Australia (CAUBE.au) today applauded the decision
by the European Parliament to protect European Internet users from the
practice of unsolicited e-mail advertisements. Yesterday's vote will turn
Europe into a virtual spam-free zone after the formal adoption of the
directive, making it illegal to send unsolicited e-mail, text message or
other similar advertisements to individuals with whom companies do not
have a preexisting business relationship.This is a tremendous day for European Internet users, said EuroCAUCE
Chairman George Mills. We are extremely pleased that the European
Parliament has listened to the citizens of its member countries and added
the right to be left alone by spammers to its efforts to protect the
privacy of Europeans.While six European Union member countries had already formalized opt-in
in their national laws and regulations, yesterday's vote should turn all
of Europe into a spam-free zone by the end of 2003.Unfortunately, the rest of the world's Internet-using countries,
including the United States, now lag behind Europe in their protection
of Internet users, said CAUCE Chairman Scott Hazen Mueller. This is
a tremendous first step, but the rest of the world now needs to follow
Europe's lead and unite behind protection of Internet users and
network owners from abusive and costly unsolicited e-mail
advertising.This decision is the direct result of Internet users throughout the
European Union standing up for their rights, and Members of the
European Parliament listening to their constituents, said Mills. Our
members and our volunteers performed an integral part of this process,
translating, lobbying and educating their representatives.More information on the E.U. directive is available on the European
Parliament's Web site ,
and a EuroCAUCE analysis is available at
. More information on
the international CAUCE network of affiliate organizations is
available at .- --------------------------------------------------------------About This Message:This message was written and broadcast by the Coalition Against

SA does have a very realistic chance of mis-marking mail so using it as an

898;http://www.hughes-family.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1012------- Additional Comments From easmith@beatrice.rutgers.edu  2002-09-21 16:41 -------
I like this idea, but from my reading - part of my dissertation research -
on GAs (or, in this case, more precisely Evolutionary Programming, since
the parameters are non-binary and the major operator is mutation, not
crossover), you do need to keep in mind that the more interactions there are
between different variables, the better-tweaked the GA/EA will need to be,
especially to avoid local optima (which may have been the problem with the
suspiciously-high anti-ratware USER_AGENT scores). From past results,
what's needed are one or more of the below:
        A. Determine mutational parameters by adapted-scores themselves,
           with variation on a per-original score basis, ideally, allow
           for having correlated mutations - in other words, have a
           mechanism in place for trying out changes to a bunch of scores at
           once, with them all moving about the same amount (albeit possibly
           in different directions) - one means to do this is found in the
           Evolutionary Strategies of Schwefel,
        B. Adapt the probability of a mutation taking place depending on how
           well previous mutation tries have done - if more than about a
           fifth of the new individuals are doing about as well as, or
           better than, the parental generation, then mutate more
           parameters, if less than a fifth of them are doing about as well
           as, or better than, the parental generation, then mutate less
           parameters.        -Allen------- You are receiving this mail because: -------

financed companies .  caterpillar helped to lead a litany of earnings woes . the peoria , illinois - based company on tuesday said its third - quarter earnings fell 5 percent because of higher expenses and less efficient manufacturing . the company also said it expects fourth - quarter revenues to be down slightly from the year - ago quarter , with full - year profit down 10 percent to 15 percent . it blamed economic uncertainty in the wake of last month ' s attacks for the expected shortfall , but added that 2002 sales will be at least flat to up slightly from 2001 levels . unisys on monday reported its third -

making broadband telecommunications business , which could involve selling the business or finding a partner .  in addition to us looking at our business on a standalone business , we clearly have entertained some discussions on other possibilities ,  chief executive officer ken lay told reuters in a telephone interview . earlier on tuesday , enron reported that one - time charges of $ 1 . 01 billion for broadband and other businesses outside its core energy operations pushed the company to a third - quarter net loss of $ 638 million , its first quarterly loss in more than four years . future options for the broadband business include  sale , partnership , all kinds of possibilities  he said .  we still think over time that it will be a valuable business ,  lay said , but for now the broadband market is in a  total meltdown  , he added . enron ' s broadband unit , which owns an 18 , 000 mile network , posted a loss of $ 80 million for the third quarter , but lay said losses should be smaller in subsequent quarters . enron launched its broadband business last year , predicting that network capacity would one day be traded like natural gas or electricity , but it has recently admitted that it overestimated the market ' s early potential and has scaled down its operations . enron ' s stock rose by 87 percent last year , driven by enthusiasm for the broadband plans and the success of the enrononline internet energy and commodity trading platform . but the stock has fallen some 59 percent so far this year as sentiment toward the broadband project soured , ceo jeff skilling resigned after only six months in the job and wrangling continued over enron ' s stalled dabhol power plan project in india . enron shares on tuesday closed up 67 cents , or 2 . 02 percent , at $ 33 . 84 . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : update 6 -

fated investments , including water and telecommunications services , which it said have clouded the strength of its core energy businesses . enron , north america ' s biggest marketer and trader of natural gas and power , said the charges were an attempt to put its house in order after a tumultuous year in which a new chief executive suddenly resigned and the company ' s stock lost two - thirds of its value as once enthusiastic investors lost faith in the company .  what we ' ve tried to do here is clean up anything that we thought needed cleaning up to get these distractions out of the way ,  chief executive officer ken lay said in a conference call . lay reassumed the ceo mantle at enron after his successor , jeff skilling , resigned in august after only six months at the helm . houston - based enron reported a third - quarter net loss of $ 638 million , or 84 cents a share , compared with net income of $ 271 million , or 34 cents a share , in the same period of 2000 . it was enron ' s first loss since the second quarter of 1997 . the charges covered the company ' s loss - making broadband telecommunications business , its troubled water affiliate azurix , and new power co . , enron ' s retail electricity joint - venture with aol / time warner and ibm . commerzbank securities analyst andre meade said it would probably take enron a few more quarters to rebuild confidence in the company which was a wall street favorite just 12 months ago .  they do a couple of things very well and if they stick to their knitting , they ' re a solid company , but they have stumbled when they strayed further afield ,  said meade . enron ' s stock closed 67 cents higher at $ 33 . 84 on tuesday , but for the year it is down about 59 percent , underperforming the standard & poor ' s utilities index . spu ) , which has fallen some 23 percent over the same period . ill - fated businesses originally a natural gas pipeline operator , enron seized on opportunities created by the deregulation of u . s . energy markets to become the nation ' s dominant wholesale marketer and trader of natural gas and electricity . the company moved into the water services business in 1998 by acquiring britain ' s wessex water and forming azurix , a unit which enron took public in 1999 but had to buy back this year after it failed to meet performance targets and its stock price tumbled . enron helped set up new power co . and take it public last year but its stock has since fallen from about $ 28 per share to less than $ 2 as companies have found it hard to make a profit in deregulated u . s . residential electricity markets . enron also launched a broadband telecommunications business last year , predicting that network capacity would one day be traded like natural gas or electricity , but it has recently admitted that it overestimated the market ' s early potential . enron ' s stock soared past sector peers last year when it posted a gain of 87 percent , driven by enthusiasm for the broadband plans and the success of its enrononline internet energy and commodity trading platform . but the stock has fallen sharply this year as broadband sentiment soured , skilling resigned and wrangling continued over enron ' s stalled dabhol power plan project in india . enron ' s third - quarter earnings before one - time charges rose to $ 393 million , or 43 cents a share , from $ 292 million , or 34 cents a share , meeting analysts ' expectations of 42 to 45 cents a share , according to thomson financial / first call . the company reaffirmed its previously stated earnings targets of 45 cents a share for the fourth quarter , $ 1 . 80 for all of 2001 and $ 2 . 15 for all of 2002 . debt on credit review rating agency moody ' s investors service on tuesday said it had placed all of enron ' s long - term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade . the writedowns would reduce enron ' s equity base , increase its nominal financial leverage and materially impact its earnings , moody ' s said . enron ' s third - quarter earnings report showed that income at its wholesale marketing and trading division , the company ' s backbone moneymaker , grew 28 percent . the division , which deals primarily in electricity and natural gas , saw pretax income rise to $ 754 million from $ 589 million in the third quarter of 2000 . all of the income growth in the segment came from enron ' s gas and power trading and marketing operations in the americas , where income grew to $ 701 million from $ 536 million last year . the european segment , which includes gas and power operations there and other commodity sales like metals , coal and crude oil , remained flat at $ 53 million amid lower volatility . the latest earnings report marked the first time that enron has provided a financial breakdown of the european and americas wholesale operations . in doing so , lay delivered on a promise he made after skilling ' s departure : that he would make enron ' s financial reporting more transparent . many analysts and investors had grumbled about a lack of clarity from enron . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron has third - quarter loss after expansion fails ( update 9 ) 2001 - 10 - 16 16 : 29 ( new york ) enron has third - quarter loss after expansion fails ( update 9 ) ( adds in sixth paragraph that losses are equal to 70 percent of enron ' s profits over the last four quarters . closes shares . ) houston , oct . 16 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . , the largest energy trader , had a $ 618 million loss in the third quarter after expansion into water , telecommunications and retail - energy sales cost the company $ 1 . 01 billion . the loss was 84 cents a share after payment of preferred dividends , enron said . net income a year earlier was $ 292 million , or 34 cents . revenue rose 59 percent to $ 47 . 6 billion . investors have sent enron stock down 60 percent this year on concern about investments outside energy trading and natural - gas pipelines . some investors praised kenneth lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive officer , for acknowledging the failure of the new businesses . others said they ' re not confident all the bad news is out . ` ` what is disconcerting is that they didn ' t do this sooner , ' ' said donald coxe , manager of the $ 352 million harris insight equity fund . ` ` if you kill one cockroach in the kitchen , it doesn ' t mean there aren ' t more . ' ' investors have questioned enron ' s financial reporting in the past year , especially after jeffrey skilling ' s resignation as ceo in august . skilling , who helped lay transform enron from a gas - pipeline company into the top competitor in energy trading , said he left for personal reasons . investors said they weren ' t confident enron was detailing all its problems . failed businesses the $ 1 . 01 billion in losses , which total $ 1 . 11 a share , are equal to 70 percent of enron ' s $ 1 . 45 billion in profits over the past four quarters . included were $ 544 million for losses on investments in new power co . , a venture formed with aol time warner inc . and international business machines corp . new power competes for energy sales in states that allow consumers to choose power and gas suppliers as they do long - distance phone companies . the $ 544 million also includes losses from the enron unit that trades space , known as bandwidth , on fiber - optic networks , as well as for the ` ` early termination of certain structured finance arrangements ' ' with an undisclosed ` ` entity . ' ' enron wouldn ' t be more specific . enron said restructuring the fiber - optic unit would cost another $ 180 million , including severance pay to 500 fired workers . the business collapsed this year along with the fortunes of the dot - com companies that were expected to be some off its biggest customers . the declining value of assets owned by azurix corp . , its water and sewage treatment business , will cost $ 287 million , enron said . enron might take a first - quarter ` ` adjustment ' ' of less than $ 200 million because of accounting changes related to goodwill , lay said in an interview . ` ` if we thought there were any other significant concerns , we would have taken care of them today , ' ' lay said . excluding losses minus the losses , enron would have earned $ 393 million , or 43 cents a share , up 35 percent from the year - earlier period . that matched the average estimate of analysts surveyed by thomson financial / first call . enron has averaged quarterly profit increases of 31 percent for the past year . its wholesale services business , which includes energy trading , had income before interest , minority interests and taxes of $ 754 million , up 28 percent from a year earlier . shares of enron rose 67 cents to $ 33 . 84 . earlier , the stock had risen as much as 5 . 2 percent to $ 34 . 90 . ` ` there ' s a sigh of relief that enron ' s core businesses , its energy merchant businesses , are ok , ' ' said roger hamilton , who helps manage john hancock ' s value funds , which own 600 , 000 shares . enron said it still expects to earn 45 cents a share in the fourth quarter , $ 1 . 80 for the full year and $ 2 . 15 in 2002 . ` ridiculous investments ' at one time , enron pinned high hopes on the businesses that contributed to the $ 1 . 01 billion in losses . enron spent $ 2 . 8 billion in 1998 for the u . k . ' s wessex water , from which azurix emerged . enron sold shares to the public in 1999 , and then bought back the company this year after azurix failed in its strategy of buying up water companies and winning large projects . in august , enron agreed to sell azurix ' s north american business to american water works inc . for $ 150 million . in february 2000 , lay said trading bandwidth could become the company ' s fastest - growing business . in the latest quarter , the bandwidth unit ' s loss before interest , minority interests and taxes widened to $ 80 million from $ 20 million a year earlier . revenue plunged to $ 4 million from $ 162 million . ` ` you can make the case that jeff skilling leaving was for the best , ' ' john hancock ' s hamilton said . ` ` under him , they built the best trading operation while also making all these ridiculous investments . ' ' while admitting its poor choices , enron also supplied more information this quarter about how it makes money . the company gave results of individual commodity - trading desks , including coal , forest products and steel . ` ` i liked that they broke out the different commodities , ' ' hamilton said . ` ` i think lay has gotten the message loud and clear , and that the effort is there .

904;My only joke, thanks to a professor at the University of Manitoba, circa 
1997. Set in the old west.A cowboy is riding along on his favorite horse when he's suddenly 
surrounded and taken prison by a band of roaming Indians. The indians 
take the cowboy and his horse and tell him the traditional way that the 
tribe deals with their victims:
Each day for the next 3 days, you get a wish. If its in our power to 
grant it to you, we will. After the 3rd wish is done, you die a horrible 
slow death. Time for your first wish.The cowboy thinks a bit, and says I want to talk to my horse. So the 
indians bring the horse over, the cowboy whispers in his ears, and the 
horse runs off. A little while later the horse comes back with a 
beautiful blond naked woman. The cowboy and the woman go in the tent, 
appropriate noises are heard, and then the horse takes the woman away.The next day, time for the wish comes, and the Indians, amazed at 
yesterday's performance, all gather round. The cowboy says I want to 
talk to my horse. So the horse is brought over, the cowboy whispers in 
its ears, and the horse takes off. A little while later the horse comes 
back, with a beautiful brunette, naked, same routine as before, cowboy 
and the women go in the tent, ..., etc.On the third and final day, the indians are totally amazed, and are 
eager to hear what the cowboy's wish will be. So they all gather round, 
and the cowboy again says I want to talk to my horse. The horse is 
brought over, and this time the cowboy grabs the horse by the head, 
stares right at him, and says -- Read my lips -- Posse! Posse!

912;question is why are they still poor?Especially given the success of Indian immigrants in other societies?South Korea was a lot poorer after the Korean war than Ghana when it gained its independence at about the same time. That was after India gained independence, and Korea couldn't have been in better shape at that point than India (my impression).> -----Original Message----- > From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of > sateesh narahari > Sent: Tuesday, August 20, 2002 12:44 PM > To: fork@spamassassin.taint.org > Subject: Re: The Curse of India's Socialism > > All good arguments, except till you realize that > majority of indians were poor even before > independence. > > Sateesh > > > --- R.

Falling asleep at the wheel is no laughing matter. Still, it kinda
happened with yesterday's
tip. I forgot to mention that the String value's label
is Logging (sans quotes). That was almost like a cliffhanger,
eh? The oversight was totally my fault. I've been thinking about
asking Gretchen and Brian to help with future reviews. Don't be
surprised if that happens soon. I'm sure you'd welcome a female
perspective on this stuff, right? She helped one of our landlords
pick a paint color for the office wall this evening. Does that
qualify her to talk about cool stuff that we find for you on the
Internet? You betcha. Let's see how she does with the drapes and
rugs. I have a feeling I'll be the one tweaking furniture layout.
Shouldn't be too much of an issue - yet. I wonder if Ikea has an
affiliate program?I've mentioned how Yahoo Mail's beta is mangling our commas, but
did you know that it's also (possibly) rewriting your e-mail? If
you send an HTML message to someone who has a yahoo.com account,
something may get lost in the translation. Try sending this
sentence: My medieval mocha has an expression to evaluate.
Again, be sure this note is sent in HTML format. The results will
surprise you. As far as I can tell, they're doing this to stop any
scripts from being distributed to their user base. I must credit
Marion Schroll for making me aware of the problem. It's kinda
funny, in a weird sort of way. Not that I would want anything I
send changed in any way, shape, or form. It begs the question:
what next? I mean, where does it all stop? Give them a bit, and
they just might take a byte. Censorship is only a stone's throw
away.I really feel for Lockergnomie Sharon Clark, who asks: What is
this crazy business with the broadband metering? What they
advertise doesn't seem to be what you get. Now that I'm forking
out $60 per month for a supposed metered rate of 640 down / 320
up, I'm feeling clueless and left out in the cold. Not sure what
I'm paying for, not sure what's going on at the office, not sure
if I'm capped, not sure if I'm getting ripped off! Can you help me
out here? I'm feeling lied to, why can't I download 'til my 40 gig
is full? That is what they promised me and that is what I THOUGHT
I was paying for. I want consistent speed - is this too much to
ask? It's not too much to ask the question, but it's probably too
much to get the answer. I'm facing the same dilemma right now,
even though cable-based connectivity isn't available in my area.
Expect more and more filters to be put in place as time marches
on. Watch those EULAs, folks.See You in August,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Chris PirilloÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â

I'd always end up with one or two that I just could never see. When I want to do the same type of comparison between two directories on my computer, I use Directory Lister and I never miss a thing. Not only does Directory Lister display the contents of your chosen directories, it will also let you save the output to an HTML file. This is great for web developers who want a quick way to list the contents of a ZIP file before archiving it and uploading it to their website. As an added bonus, Directory Lister also shows the date, time, and attributes of the files in your directory, making it easier than ever to compare the differences in files between two directories.
Web Calendar [25k] W2k/XP FREEhttp://members.lycos.co.uk/bleucanard/WebCalendar.htm{Web page reminder} Surfing the web as much as I do, I'll occasionally run into a site or page that commits the horrendous faux pas of displaying an Under Construction banner. I COULD forget about the site and maybe somehow encounter it later, or I COULD drop the site into Web Calendar and have this handy-dandy app remind me to check the page again in a week. The same technique holds true for my normal browsing... for example, I can use Web Calendar to remind me to check out the Digital Media newsletter every morning, or to check Amazon for a CD that I know will be released in a week. Now, I will have no excuse for missing the DVD release of Lord of the Rings...Recommend It!

(It) automatically detects all available ODBC data sources and displays them in an explorer-like tree. User(s) may double-click on data sources to access the databases, browse tables, execute custom queries and export (the) data to .CSV or .XML files. I didn't really have much on my machine to throw at this program. However, the one data source I did have (mostly related to Music CD creation) displayed perfectly in SQL View.

CollegeBAR v8.0 [5.9M] W9x/2k/XP US$20
    Unearthed by Shawn Verrallhttp://www.pracx.com/collegebar.asp
 
{Mix your own drinks} When I was in college, my room used to be known as The Bar. It may have had something do with my L-shaped desk that resembled a bar, and the fact that I had seen the movie Cocktail too many times and wanted to be a bottle-flipping bartender. I never achieved my goal of being the world's best geek bartender, but maybe with College Bar I could have. College Bar contains recipes for over 11,600 drinks. With an online update feature, you can download new drinks as they become available... or you can add your own creative concoctions to the database! College Bar also has a calculator to determine someone's blood alcohol level... drink responsibly, folks. As an added bonus, you can load some of your favorite party pictures into the program and you'll see a slide show of those pictures - a great way to remember the good times... unless you don't remember experiencing them in the first place, that is. Dude, where's my car?Submit Your Thoughts  Recommend It!

Â GnomeTIPI am a sucker for keyboard shortcuts. Anything that can save me from using the mouse is good in my book. Occasionally I like to view the web or Windows Explorer in Full Screen mode... to do this I just hit F11 on the keyboard and there I am in Full Screen mode. Hit it again and I am back to regular mode. If you aren't as much of a fan of keyboard shortcuts as me, then all you have to do is press and hold the Ctrl key while clicking on the Maximize button and you will have the same effect. You will notice, however, that your Start Menu isn't anywhere to be seen. Never fear, another keyboard shortcut is here... just press Ctrl key plus the Esc key and your Start Menu will be back where it belongs. Alternatively, if you have a Windows key on your keyboard you can use that key to bring up your Start Menu as well.

949;> A world where some live in comfort and plenty, while half of the human 
> race lives on less than $2 a day, is neither just nor stable.Absolutely correct. Perhaps the most fundamental thing to realize about 
life on Earth today.The following is a fascinating document of official Government policy 
that bears close reading. It is the aspirations of a wonderful nation in 
an imperfect world.>  The war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations. It does, 
> however, reveal the clash inside a civilization, a battle for the 
> future of the Muslim world. This is a struggle of ideas and this is an 
> area where America must excel.I was recently at a lecture about the surprising success of Radio Sawa, 
our new music-and-news channel for 15-30 year old Arabs. It's #1 in 
practically every market it's entered, nearing 90% listenership in 
Amman. And it's even beginning to be trusted for news, well past BBC and 
taking share from every other government broadcaster.It is as hard to imagine America losing a war of ideas in the long-term 
as it is to imagine America making any headway at all in the short term.Many of you may disagree, but I found the document below surprisingly 
centrist. If you know the code, you can hear clearly partisan tones, re: 
ICC, Taiwan Relations Act, etc. But, still, this is as much a Democratic 
platform as not. Africa and AIDS take up more mindshare than I feared 
they might.As you read, replace United States with Roman Empire and it may make 
as much sense, in the long view of history. I don't know how proud to be 
about that, but it is telling. Sometime I daydream that the President 
might sit down with the nation with Perotista flip charts and explain to 
our citizens the sheer vastness of our 700+ military installations 
overseas and what they do for us. It would be a powerful education on 
how engaged we are in the world around us.Heck, I'd love to see a real-time map of Federal expenditures around the 
globe, a softly glowing necklace of embassies, carriers, arctic research 
stations, hotels, golf courses, warehouses, libraries, clinics and all 
the rest of the influence a trillion dollars here or there can buy.Of course, this still doesn't leave me any more comfortable with the 
real news in this document: the Bush Doctrine for pre-emptive strikes. 
I'd sooner repeal the Church amendments on covert action than permit 
such a principle to be loosed upon the world.Rohit-----------------------------------------------------
September 20, 2002Full Text: Bush's National Security StrategyFollowing is the full text of President Bush's new national security 
strategy. The document, entitled The National Security Strategy of the 
United States, will soon be transmitted to Congress as a declaration of 
the Administration's policy.INTRODUCTIONTHE great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and 
totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of 
freedom -- and a single sustainable model for national success: freedom, 
democracy, and free enterprise. In the twenty-first century, only 
nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and 
guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the 
potential of their people and assure their future prosperity. People 
everywhere want to say what they think, choose who will govern them, 
worship as they please, educate their children -- male and female, own 
property, and enjoy the benefits of their labor. These values of freedom 
are right and true for every person, in every society -- and the duty of 
protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of 
freedom-loving people across the globe and across the ages.Today, the United States enjoys a position of unparalleled military 
strength and great economic and political influence. In keeping with our 
heritage and principles, we do not use our strength to press for 
unilateral advantage. We seek instead to create a balance of power that 
favors human freedom: conditions in which all nations and all societies 
can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and 
economic liberty. By making the world safer, we allow the people of the 
world to make their own lives better. We will defend this just peace 
against threats from terrorists and tyrants. We will preserve the peace 
by building good relations among the great powers. We will extend the 
peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent.Defending our Nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental 
commitment of the Federal Government. Today, that task has changed 
dramatically. Enemies in the past needed great armies and great 
industrial capabilities to endanger America. Now, shadowy networks of 
individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less 
than it costs to purchase a single tank. Terrorists are organized to 
penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies 
against us.To defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal -- 
from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and 
cutting off terrorist financing. The war against terrorists of global 
reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration. America will help 
nations that need our assistance in combating terror. And America will 
hold to account nations that are compromised by terror -- because the 
allies of terror are the enemies of civilization. The United States and 
countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop 
new home bases. Together, we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every 
turn.The gravest danger our Nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism 
and technology. Our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking 
weapons of mass destruction, and evidence indicates that they are doing 
so with determination. The United States will not allow these efforts to 
succeed. We will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other 
means of delivery. We will cooperate with other nations to deny, 
contain, and curtail our enemies' efforts to acquire dangerous 
technologies. And, as a matter of common sense and self-defense, America 
will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed. We 
cannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best. So we must 
be prepared to defeat our enemies' plans, using the best intelligence 
and proceeding with deliberation. History will judge harshly those who 
saw this coming danger but failed to act. In the new world we have 
entered, the only path to safety is the path of action.As we defend the peace, we will also take advantage of an historic 
opportunity to preserve the peace. Today, the international community 
has the best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the 
seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace 
instead of continually prepare for war. Today, the world's great powers 
find ourselves on the same side -- united by common dangers of terrorist 
violence and chaos. The United States will build on these common 
interests to promote global security. We are also increasingly united by 
common values. Russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition, reaching 
for its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror. Chinese 
leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of 
national wealth. In time, they will find that social and political 
freedom is the only source of national greatness. America will encourage 
the advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations, 
because these are the best foundations for domestic stability and 
international order. We will strongly resist aggression from other great 
powers -- even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity, 
trade, and cultural advancement.Finally, the United States will use this moment of opportunity to extend 
the benefits of freedom across the globe. We will actively work to bring 
the hope of democracy, development, free markets, and free trade to 
every corner of the world. The events of September 11, 2001, taught us 
that weak states, like Afghanistan, can pose as great a danger to our 
national interests as strong states. Poverty does not make poor people 
into terrorists and murderers. Yet poverty, weak institutions, and 
corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and 
drug cartels within their borders.The United States will stand beside any nation determined to build a 
better future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people. Free 
trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies 
out of poverty -- so the United States will work with individual 
nations, entire regions, and the entire global trading community to 
build a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity. 
The United States will deliver greater development assistance through 
the New Millennium Challenge Account to nations that govern justly, 
invest in their people, and encourage economic freedom. We will also 
continue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of 
AIDS and other infectious diseases.In building a balance of power that favors freedom, the United States is 
guided by the conviction that all nations have important 
responsibilities. Nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror. 
Nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the 
spread of weapons of mass destruction. Nations that seek international 
aid must govern themselves wisely, so that aid is well spent. For 
freedom to thrive, accountability must be expected and required.We are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer, 
better world alone. Alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply 
the strength of freedom-loving nations. The United States is committed 
to lasting institutions like the United Nations, the World Trade 
Organization, the Organization of American States, and NATO as well as 
other long-standing alliances. Coalitions of the willing can augment 
these permanent institutions. In all cases, international obligations 
are to be taken seriously. They are not to be undertaken symbolically to 
rally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment.Freedom is the non-negotiable demand of human dignity, the birthright of 
every person -- in every civilization. Throughout history, freedom has 
been threatened by war and terror, it has been challenged by the 
clashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants, and 
it has been tested by widespread poverty and disease. Today, humanity 
holds in its hands the opportunity to further freedom's triumph over all 
these foes. The United States welcomes our responsibility to lead in 
this great mission.I. Overview of America's International Strategy
Our Nation's cause has always been larger than our Nation's defense. We 
fight, as we always fight, for a just peace -- a peace that favors 
liberty. We will defend the peace against the threats from terrorists 
and tyrants. We will preserve the peace by building good relations among 
the great powers. And we will extend the peace by encouraging free and 
open societies on every continent.
President Bush
West Point, New York
June 1, 2002The United States possesses unprecedented -- and unequaled -- strength 
and influence in the world. Sustained by faith in the principles of 
liberty, and the value of a free society, this position comes with 
unparalleled responsibilities, obligations, and opportunity. The great 
strength of this nation must be used to promote a balance of power that 
favors freedom.For most of the twentieth century, the world was divided by a great 
struggle over ideas: destructive totalitarian visions versus freedom and 
equality.That great struggle is over. The militant visions of class, nation, and 
race which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and 
discredited. America is now threatened less by conquering states than we 
are by failing ones. We are menaced less by fleets and armies than by 
catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few. We must 
defeat these threats to our Nation, allies, and friends.This is also a time of opportunity for America. We will work to 
translate this moment of influence into decades of peace, prosperity, 
and liberty. The U.S. national security strategy will be based on a 
distinctly American internationalism that reflects the union of our 
values and our national interests. The aim of this strategy is to help 
make the world not just safer but better. Our goals on the path to 
progress are clear: political and economic freedom, peaceful relations 
with other states, and respect for human dignity.And this path is not America's alone. It is open to all.To achieve these goals, the United States will:*	champion aspirations for human dignity,*	strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent 
attacks against us and our friends,*	work with others to defuse regional conflicts,*	prevent our enemies from threatening us, our allies, and our 
friends, with weapons of mass destruction,*	ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and 
free trade,*	expand the circle of development by opening societies and building 
the infrastructure of democracy,*	develop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of 
global power, and*	transform America's national security institutions to meet the 
challenges and opportunities of the twenty-first century.
II. Champion Aspirations for Human Dignity
Some worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak the 
language of right and wrong. I disagree. Different circumstances require 
different methods, but not different moralities.President Bush
West Point, New York
June 1, 2002In pursuit of our goals, our first imperative is to clarify what we 
stand for: the United States must defend liberty and justice because 
these principles are right and true for all people everywhere. No nation 
owns these aspirations, and no nation is exempt from them. Fathers and 
mothers in all societies want their children to be educated and to live 
free from poverty and violence. No people on earth yearn to be 
oppressed, aspire to servitude, or eagerly await the midnight knock of 
the secret police.America must stand firmly for the nonnegotiable demands of human 
dignity: the rule of law, limits on the absolute power of the state, 
free speech, freedom of worship, equal justice, respect for women, 
religious and ethnic tolerance, and respect for private property.These demands can be met in many ways. America's constitution has served 
us well. Many other nations, with different histories and cultures, 
facing different circumstances, have successfully incorporated these 
core principles into their own systems of governance. History has not 
been kind to those nations which ignored or flouted the rights and 
aspirations of their people.Our own history is a long struggle to live up to our ideals. But even in 
our worst moments, the principles enshrined in the Declaration of 
Independence were there to guide us. As a result, America is not just a 
stronger, but is a freer and more just society.Today, these ideals are a lifeline to lonely defenders of liberty. And 
when openings arrive, we can encourage change -- as we did in central 
and eastern Europe between 1989 and 1991, or in Belgrade in 2000. When 
we see democratic processes take hold among our friends in Taiwan or in 
the Republic of Korea, and see elected leaders replace generals in Latin 
America and Africa, we see examples of how authoritarian systems can 
evolve, marrying local history and traditions with the principles we all 
cherish.Embodying lessons from our past and using the opportunity we have today, 
the national security strategy of the United States must start from 
these core beliefs and look outward for possibilities to expand liberty.Our principles will guide our government's decisions about international 
cooperation, the character of our foreign assistance, and the allocation 
of resources. They will guide our actions and our words in international 
bodies.We will:*	speak out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of 
human dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to 
advance freedom,*	use our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who 
struggle non-violently for it, ensuring that nations moving toward 
democracy are rewarded for the steps they take,*	make freedom and the development of democratic institutions key 
themes in our bilateral relations, seeking solidarity and cooperation 
from other democracies while we press governments that deny human rights 
to move toward a better future, and*	take special efforts to promote freedom of religion and conscience 
and defend it from encroachment by repressive governments.
We will champion the cause of human dignity and oppose those who resist 
it.III. Strengthen Alliances to Defeat Global Terrorism and Work to Prevent 
Attacks Against Us and Our Friends
Just three days removed from these events, Americans do not yet have 
the distance of history. But our responsibility to history is already 
clear: to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil. War has been 
waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder. This nation is 
peaceful, but fierce when stirred to anger. The conflict was begun on 
the timing and terms of others. It will end in a way, and at an hour, of 
our choosing.President Bush
Washington, D.C. (The National Cathedral)
September 14, 2001The United States of America is fighting a war against terrorists of 
global reach. The enemy is not a single political regime or person or 
religion or ideology. The enemy is terrorism -- premeditated, 
politically motivated violence perpetrated against innocents.In many regions, legitimate grievances prevent the emergence of a 
lasting peace. Such grievances deserve to be, and must be, addressed 
within a political process. But no cause justifies terror. The United 
States will make no concessions to terrorist demands and strike no deals 
with them. We make no distinction between terrorists and those who 
knowingly harbor or provide aid to them.The struggle against global terrorism is different from any other war in 
our history. It will be fought on many fronts against a particularly 
elusive enemy over an extended period of time. Progress will come 
through the persistent accumulation of successes -- some seen, some 
unseen.Today our enemies have seen the results of what civilized nations can, 
and will, do against regimes that harbor, support, and use terrorism to 
achieve their political goals. Afghanistan has been liberated, coalition 
forces continue to hunt down the Taliban and al-Qaida. But it is not 
only this battlefield on which we will engage terrorists. Thousands of 
trained terrorists remain at large with cells in North America, South 
America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and across Asia.Our priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist 
organizations of global reach and attack their leadership, command, 
control, and communications, material support, and finances. This will 
have a disabling effect upon the terrorists' ability to plan and operate.We will continue to encourage our regional partners to take up a 
coordinated effort that isolates the terrorists. Once the regional 
campaign localizes the threat to a particular state, we will help ensure 
the state has the military, law enforcement, political, and financial 
tools necessary to finish the task.The United States will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the 
financing of terrorism. We will identify and block the sources of 
funding for terrorism, freeze the assets of terrorists and those who 
support them, deny terrorists access to the international financial 
system, protect legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists, 
and prevent the movement of terrorists' assets through alternative 
financial networks.However, this campaign need not be sequential to be effective, the 
cumulative effect across all regions will help achieve the results we 
seek.We will disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations by:*	direct and continuous action using all the elements of national and 
international power. Our immediate focus will be those terrorist 
organizations of global reach and any terrorist or state sponsor of 
terrorism which attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction 
(WMD) or their precursors,*	defending the United States, the American people, and our interests 
at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it 
reaches our borders. While the United States will constantly strive to 
enlist the support of the international community, we will not hesitate 
to act alone, if necessary, to exercise our right of self-defense by 
acting preemptively against such terrorists, to prevent them from doing 
harm against our people and our country, and*	denying further sponsorship, support, and sanctuary to terrorists 
by convincing or compelling states to accept their sovereign 
responsibilities.
We will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle against international 
terrorism. This includes:*	using the full influence of the United States, and working closely 
with allies and friends, to make clear that all acts of terrorism are 
illegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed in the same light as 
slavery, piracy, or genocide: behavior that no respectable government 
can condone or support and all must oppose,*	supporting moderate and modern government, especially in the Muslim 
world, to ensure that the conditions and ideologies that promote 
terrorism do not find fertile ground in any nation,*	diminishing the underlying conditions that spawn terrorism by 
enlisting the international community to focus its efforts and resources 
on areas most at risk, and*	using effective public diplomacy to promote the free flow of 
information and ideas to kindle the hopes and aspirations of freedom of 
those in societies ruled by the sponsors of global terrorism.
While we recognize that our best defense is a good offense we are also 
strengthening America's homeland security to protect against and deter 
attack.This Administration has proposed the largest government reorganization 
since the Truman Administration created the National Security Council 
and the Department of Defense. Centered on a new Department of Homeland 
Security and including a new unified military command and a fundamental 
reordering of the FBI, our comprehensive plan to secure the homeland 
encompasses every level of government and the cooperation of the public 
and the private sector.This strategy will turn adversity into opportunity. For example, 
emergency management systems will be better able to cope not just with 
terrorism but with all hazards. Our medical system will be strengthened 
to manage not just bioterror, but all infectious diseases and 
mass-casualty dangers. Our border controls will not just stop 
terrorists, but improve the efficient movement of legitimate traffic.While our focus is protecting America, we know that to defeat terrorism 
in today's globalized world we need support from our allies and friends. 
Wherever possible, the United States will rely on regional organizations 
and state powers to meet their obligations to fight terrorism. Where 
governments find the fight against terrorism beyond their capacities, we 
will match their willpower and their resources with whatever help we and 
our allies can provide.As we pursue the terrorists in Afghanistan, we will continue to work 
with international organizations such as the United Nations, as well as 
non-governmental organizations, and other countries to provide the 
humanitarian, political, economic, and security assistance necessary to 
rebuild Afghanistan so that it will never again abuse its people, 
threaten its neighbors, and provide a haven for terroristsIn the war against global terrorism, we will never forget that we are 
ultimately fighting for our democratic values and way of life. Freedom 
and fear are at war, and there will be no quick or easy end to this 
conflict. In leading the campaign against terrorism, we are forging new, 
productive international relationships and redefining existing ones in 
ways that meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.IV. Work with Others To Defuse Regional Conflicts
We build a world of justice, or we will live in a world of coercion. 
The magnitude of our shared responsibilities makes our disagreements 
look so small.President Bush
Berlin, Germany
May 23, 2002Concerned nations must remain actively engaged in critical regional 
disputes to avoid explosive escalation and minimize human suffering. In 
an increasingly interconnected world, regional crisis can strain our 
alliances, rekindle rivalries among the major powers, and create 
horrifying affronts to human dignity. When violence erupts and states 
falter, the United States will work with friends and partners to 
alleviate suffering and restore stability.No doctrine can anticipate every circumstance in which U.S. action -- 
direct or indirect -- is warranted. We have finite political, economic, 
and military resources to meet our global priorities. The United States 
will approach each case with these strategic principles in mind:*	The United States should invest time and resources into building 
international relationships and institutions that can help manage local 
crises when they emerge.*	The United States should be realistic about its ability to help 
those who are unwilling or unready to help themselves. Where and when 
people are ready to do their part, we will be willing to move decisively.
Policies in several key regions offer some illustrations of how we will 
apply these principles:The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is critical because of the toll of 
human suffering, because of America's close relationship with the state 
of Israel and key Arab states, and because of that region's importance 
to other global priorities of the United States. There can be no peace 
for either side without freedom for both sides. America stands committed 
to an independent and democratic Palestine, living beside Israel in 
peace and security. Like all other people, Palestinians deserve a 
government that serves their interests, and listens to their voices, and 
counts their votes. The United States will continue to encourage all 
parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and 
comprehensive settlement to the conflict.The United States, the international donor community, and the World Bank 
stand ready to work with a reformed Palestinian government on economic 
development, increased humanitarian assistance and a program to 
establish, finance, and monitor a truly independent judiciary. If 
Palestinians embrace democracy, and the rule of law, confront 
corruption, and firmly reject terror, they can count on American support 
for the creation of a Palestinian state.Israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic Palestine. 
Permanent occupation threatens Israel's identity and democracy. So the 
United States continues to challenge Israeli leaders to take concrete 
steps to support the emergence of a viable, credible Palestinian state. 
As there is progress towards security, Israel forces need to withdraw 
fully to positions they held prior to September 28, 2000. And consistent 
with the recommendations of the Mitchell Committee, Israeli settlement 
activity in the occupied territories must stop. As violence subsides, 
freedom of movement should be restored, permitting innocent Palestinians 
to resume work and normal life. The United States can play a crucial 
role but, ultimately, lasting peace can only come when Israelis and 
Palestinians resolve the issues and end the conflict between them.In South Asia, the United States has also emphasized the need for India 
and Pakistan to resolve their disputes. This administration invested 
time and resources building strong bilateral relations with India and 
Pakistan. These strong relations then gave us leverage to play a 
constructive role when tensions in the region became acute. With 
Pakistan, our bilateral relations have been bolstered by Pakistan's 
choice to join the war against terror and move toward building a more 
open and tolerant society. The Administration sees India's potential to 
become one of the great democratic powers of the twenty-first century 
and has worked hard to transform our relationship accordingly. Our 
involvement in this regional dispute, building on earlier investments in 
bilateral relations, looks first to concrete steps by India and Pakistan 
that can help defuse military confrontation.Indonesia took courageous steps to create a working democracy and 
respect for the rule of law. By tolerating ethnic minorities, respecting 
the rule of law, and accepting open markets, Indonesia may be able to 
employ the engine of opportunity that has helped lift some of its 
neighbors out of poverty and desperation. It is the initiative by 
Indonesia that allows U.S. assistance to make a difference.In the Western Hemisphere we have formed flexible coalitions with 
countries that share our priorities, particularly Mexico, Brazil, 
Canada, Chile, and Colombia. Together we will promote a truly democratic 
hemisphere where our integration advances security, prosperity, 
opportunity, and hope. We will work with regional institutions, such as 
the Summit of the Americas process, the Organization of American States 
(OAS), and the Defense Ministerial of the Americas for the benefit of 
the entire hemisphere.Parts of Latin America confront regional conflict, especially arising 
from the violence of drug cartels and their accomplices. This conflict 
and unrestrained narcotics trafficking could imperil the health and 
security of the United States. Therefore we have developed an active 
strategy to help the Andean nations adjust their economies, enforce 
their laws, defeat terrorist organizations, and cut off the supply of 
drugs, while -- as important -- we work to reduce the demand for drugs 
in our own country.In Colombia, we recognize the link between terrorist and extremist 
groups that challenge the security of the state and drug trafficking 
activities that help finance the operations of such groups. We are 
working to help Colombia defend its democratic institutions and defeat 
illegal armed groups of both the left and right by extending effective 
sovereignty over the entire national territory and provide basic 
security to the Colombian people.In Africa, promise and opportunity sit side by side with disease, war, 
and desperate poverty. This threatens both a core value of the United 
States -- preserving human dignity -- and our strategic priority -- 
combating global terror. American interests and American principles, 
therefore, lead in the same direction: we will work with others for an 
African continent that lives in liberty, peace, and growing prosperity. 
Together with our European allies, we must help strengthen Africa's 
fragile states, help build indigenous capability to secure porous 
borders, and help build up the law enforcement and intelligence 
infrastructure to deny havens for terrorists.An ever more lethal environment exists in Africa as local civil wars 
spread beyond borders to create regional war zones. Forming coalitions 
of the willing and cooperative security arrangements are key to 
confronting these emerging transnational threats.Africa's great size and diversity requires a security strategy that 
focuses bilateral engagement, and builds coalitions of the willing. This 
administration will focus on three interlocking strategies for the 
region:*	countries with major impact on their neighborhood such as South 
Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, and Ethiopia are anchors for regional engagement 
and require focused attention,*	coordination with European allies and international institutions is 
essential for constructive conflict mediation and successful peace 
operations, and*	Africa's capable reforming states and sub-regional organizations 
must be strengthened as the primary means to address transnational 
threats on a sustained basis.
Ultimately the path of political and economic freedom presents the 
surest route to progress in sub-Saharan Africa, where most wars are 
conflicts over material resources and political access often tragically 
waged on the basis of ethnic and religious difference. The transition to 
the African Union with its stated commitment to good governance and a 
common responsibility for democratic political systems offers 
opportunities to strengthen democracy on the continent.V. Prevent Our Enemies from Threatening Us, Our Allies, and Our Friends 
with Weapons of Mass Destruction
The gravest danger to freedom lies at the crossroads of radicalism and 
technology. When the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear 
weapons, along with ballistic missile technology -- when that occurs, 
even weak states and small groups could attain a catastrophic power to 
strike great nations. Our enemies have declared this very intention, and 
have been caught seeking these terrible weapons. They want the 
capability to blackmail us, or to harm us, or to harm our friends -- and 
we will oppose them with all our power.President Bush
West Point, New York
June 1, 2002The nature of the Cold War threat required the United States -- with our 
allies and friends -- to emphasize deterrence of the enemy's use of 
force, producing a grim strategy of mutual assured destruction. With the 
collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, our security 
environment has undergone profound transformation.Having moved from confrontation to cooperation as the hallmark of our 
relationship with Russia, the dividends are evident: an end to the 
balance of terror that divided us, an historic reduction in the nuclear 
arsenals on both sides, and cooperation in areas such as 
counterterrorism and missile defense that until recently were 
inconceivable.But new deadly challenges have emerged from rogue states and terrorists. 
None of these contemporary threats rival the sheer destructive power 
that was arrayed against us by the Soviet Union. However, the nature and 
motivations of these new adversaries, their determination to obtain 
destructive powers hitherto available only to the world's strongest 
states, and the greater likelihood that they will use weapons of mass 
destruction against us, make today's security environment more complex 
and dangerous.In the 1990s we witnessed the emergence of a small number of rogue 
states that, while different in important ways, share a number of 
attributes. These states:*	brutalize their own people and squander their national resources 
for the personal gain of the rulers,*	display no regard for international law, threaten their neighbors, 
and callously violate international treaties to which they are party,*	are determined to acquire weapons of mass destruction, along with 
other advanced military technology, to be used as threats or offensively 
to achieve the aggressive designs of these regimes,*	sponsor terrorism around the globe, and*	reject basic human values and hate the United States and everything 
for which it stands.
At the time of the Gulf War, we acquired irrefutable proof that Iraq's 
designs were not limited to the chemical weapons it had used against 
Iran and its own people, but also extended to the acquisition of nuclear 
weapons and biological agents. In the past decade North Korea has become 
the world's principal purveyor of ballistic missiles, and has tested 
increasingly capable missiles while developing its own WMD arsenal. 
Other rogue regimes seek nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons as 
well. These states' pursuit of, and global trade in, such weapons has 
become a looming threat to all nations.We must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients 
before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction 
against the United States and our allies and friends. Our response must 
take full advantage of strengthened alliances, the establishment of new 
partnerships with former adversaries, innovation in the use of military 
forces, modern technologies, including the development of an effective 
missile defense system, and increased emphasis on intelligence 
collection and analysis.Our comprehensive strategy to combat WMD includes:*	Proactive counterproliferation efforts. We must deter and defend 
against the threat before it is unleashed. We must ensure that key 
capabilities -- detection, active and passive defenses, and counterforce 
capabilities -- are integrated into our defense transformation and our 
homeland security systems. Counterproliferation must also be integrated 
into the doctrine, training, and equipping of our forces and those of 
our allies to ensure that we can prevail in any conflict with WMD-armed 
adversaries.*	Strengthened nonproliferation efforts to prevent rogue states and 
terrorists from acquiring the materials, technologies and expertise 
necessary for weapons of mass destruction. We will enhance diplomacy, 
arms control, multilateral export controls, and threat reduction 
assistance that impede states and terrorists seeking WMD, and when 
necessary, interdict enabling technologies and materials. We will 
continue to build coalitions to support these efforts, encouraging their 
increased political and financial support for nonproliferation and 
threat reduction programs. The recent G-8 agreement to commit up to $20 
billion to a global partnership against proliferation marks a major step 
forward.*	Effective consequence management to respond to the effects of WMD 
use, whether by terrorists or hostile states. Minimizing the effects of 
WMD use against our people will help deter those who possess such 
weapons and dissuade those who seek to acquire them by persuading 
enemies that they cannot attain their desired ends. The United States 
must also be prepared to respond to the effects of WMD use against our 
forces abroad, and to help friends and allies if they are attacked.
It has taken almost a decade for us to comprehend the true nature of 
this new threat. Given the goals of rogue states and terrorists, the 
United States can no longer solely rely on a reactive posture as we have 
in the past. The inability to deter a potential attacker, the immediacy 
of today's threats, and the magnitude of potential harm that could be 
caused by our adversaries' choice of weapons, do not permit that option. 
We cannot let our enemies strike first.*	In the Cold War, especially following the Cuban missile crisis, we 
faced a generally status quo, risk-averse adversary. Deterrence was an 
effective defense. But deterrence based only upon the threat of 
retaliation is far less likely to work against leaders of rogue states 
more willing to take risks, gambling with the lives of their people, and 
the wealth of their nations.*	In the Cold War, weapons of mass destruction were considered 
weapons of last resort whose use risked the destruction of those who 
used them. Today, our enemies see weapons of mass destruction as weapons 
of choice. For rogue states these weapons are tools of intimidation and 
military aggression against their neighbors. These weapons may also 
allow these states to attempt to blackmail the United States and our 
allies to prevent us from deterring or repelling the aggressive behavior 
of rogue states. Such states also see these weapons as their best means 
of overcoming the conventional superiority of the United States.*	Traditional concepts of deterrence will not work against a 
terrorist enemy whose avowed tactics are wanton destruction and the 
targeting of innocents, whose so-called soldiers seek martyrdom in death 
and whose most potent protection is statelessness. The overlap between 
states that sponsor terror and those that pursue WMD compels us to 
action.
For centuries, international law recognized that nations need not suffer 
an attack before they can lawfully take action to defend themselves 
against forces that present an imminent danger of attack. Legal scholars 
and international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of preemption 
on the existence of an imminent threat -- most often a visible 
mobilization of armies, navies, and air forces preparing to attack.We must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and 
objectives of today's adversaries. Rogue states and terrorists do not 
seek to attack us using conventional means. They know such attacks would 
fail. Instead, they rely on acts of terrorism and, potentially, the use 
of weapons of mass destruction -- weapons that can be easily concealed 
and delivered covertly and without warning.The targets of these attacks are our military forces and our civilian 
population, in direct violation of one of the principal norms of the law 
of warfare. As was demonstrated by the losses on September 11, 2001, 
mass civilian casualties is the specific objective of terrorists and 
these losses would be exponentially more severe if terrorists acquired 
and used weapons of mass destruction.The United States has long maintained the option of preemptive actions 
to counter a sufficient threat to our national security. The greater the 
threat, the greater is the risk of inaction -- and the more compelling 
the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves, even if 
uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy's attack. To 
forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries, the United 
States will, if necessary, act preemptively.The United States will not use force in all cases to preempt emerging 
threats, nor should nations use preemption as a pretext for aggression. 
Yet in an age where the enemies of civilization openly and actively seek 
the world's most destructive technologies, the United States cannot 
remain idle while dangers gather.We will always proceed deliberately, weighing the consequences of our 
actions. To support preemptive options, we will:*	build better, more integrated intelligence capabilities to provide 
timely, accurate information on threats, wherever they may emerge,*	coordinate closely with allies to form a common assessment of the 
most dangerous threats, and*	continue to transform our military forces to ensure our ability to 
conduct rapid and precise operations to achieve decisive results.
The purpose of our actions will always be to eliminate a specific threat 
to the United States or our allies and friends. The reasons for our 
actions will be clear, the force measured, and the cause just.VI. Ignite a New Era of Global Economic Growth through Free Markets and 
Free Trade.
When nations close their markets and opportunity is hoarded by a 
privileged few, no amount -- no amount -- of development aid is ever 
enough. When nations respect their people, open markets, invest in 
better health and education, every dollar of aid, every dollar of trade 
revenue and domestic capital is used more effectively.President Bush
Monterrey, Mexico
March 22, 2002A strong world economy enhances our national security by advancing 
prosperity and freedom in the rest of the world. Economic growth 
supported by free trade and free markets creates new jobs and higher 
incomes. It allows people to lift their lives out of poverty, spurs 
economic and legal reform, and the fight against corruption, and it 
reinforces the habits of liberty.We will promote economic growth and economic freedom beyond America's 
shores. All governments are responsible for creating their own economic 
policies and responding to their own economic challenge. We will use our 
economic engagement with other countries to underscore the benefits of 
policies that generate higher productivity and sustained economic 
growth, including:*	pro-growth legal and regulatory policies to encourage business 
investment, innovation, and entrepreneurial activity,*	tax policies -- particularly lower marginal tax rates -- that 
improve incentives for work and investment,*	rule of law and intolerance of corruption so that people are 
confident that they will be able to enjoy the fruits of their economic 
endeavors,*	strong financial systems that allow capital to be put to its most 
efficient use,*	sound fiscal policies to support business activity,*	investments in health and education that improve the well-being and 
skills of the labor force and population as a whole, and*	free trade that provides new avenues for growth and fosters the 
diffusion of technologies and ideas that increase productivity and 
opportunity.
The lessons of history are clear: market economies, not 
command-and-control economies with the heavy hand of government, are the 
best way to promote prosperity and reduce poverty. Policies that further 
strengthen market incentives and market institutions are relevant for 
all economies -- industrialized countries, emerging markets, and the 
developing world.A return to strong economic growth in Europe and Japan is vital to U.S. 
national security interests. We want our allies to have strong economies 
for their own sake, for the sake of the global economy, and for the sake 
of global security. European efforts to remove structural barriers in 
their economies are particularly important in this regard, as are 
Japan's efforts to end deflation and address the problems of 
non-performing loans in the Japanese banking system. We will continue to 
use our regular consultations with Japan and our European partners -- 
including through the Group of Seven (G-7) -- to discuss policies they 
are adopting to promote growth in their economies and support higher 
global economic growth.Improving stability in emerging markets is also key to global economic 
growth. International flows of investment capital are needed to expand 
the productive potential of these economies. These flows allow emerging 
markets and developing countries to make the investments that raise 
living standards and reduce poverty. Our long-term objective should be a 
world in which all countries have investment-grade credit ratings that 
allow them access to international capital markets and to invest in 
their future.We are committed to policies that will help emerging markets achieve 
access to larger capital flows at lower cost. To this end, we will 
continue to pursue reforms aimed at reducing uncertainty in financial 
markets. We will work actively with other countries, the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF), and the private sector to implement the G-7 Action 
Plan negotiated earlier this year for preventing financial crises and 
more effectively resolving them when they occur.The best way to deal with financial crises is to prevent them from 
occurring, and we have encouraged the IMF to improve its efforts doing 
so. We will continue to work with the IMF to streamline the policy 
conditions for its lending and to focus its lending strategy on 
achieving economic growth through sound fiscal and monetary policy, 
exchange rate policy, and financial sector policy.The concept of free trade arose as a moral principle even before it 
became a pillar of economics. If you can make something that others 
value, you should be able to sell it to them. If others make something 
that you value, you should be able to buy it. This is real freedom, the 
freedom for a person -- or a nation -- to make a living. To promote free 
trade, the Unites States has developed a comprehensive strategy:*	Seize the global initiative. The new global trade negotiations we 
helped launch at Doha in November 2001 will have an ambitious agenda, 
especially in agriculture, manufacturing, and services, targeted for 
completion in 2005. The United States has led the way in completing the 
accession of China and a democratic Taiwan to the World Trade 
Organization. We will assist Russia's preparations to join the WTO.*	Press regional initiatives. The United States and other democracies 
in the Western Hemisphere have agreed to create the Free Trade Area of 
the Americas, targeted for completion in 2005. This year the United 
States will advocate market-access negotiations with its partners, 
targeted on agriculture, industrial goods, services, investment, and 
government procurement. We will also offer more opportunity to the 
poorest continent, Africa, starting with full use of the preferences 
allowed in the African Growth and Opportunity Act, and leading to free 
trade.*	Move ahead with bilateral free trade agreements. Building on the 
free trade agreement with Jordan enacted in 2001, the Administration 
will work this year to complete free trade agreements with Chile and 
Singapore. Our aim is to achieve free trade agreements with a mix of 
developed and developing countries in all regions of the world. 
Initially, Central America, Southern Africa, Morocco, and Australia will 
be our principal focal points.*	Renew the executive-congressional partnership. Every 
administration's trade strategy depends on a productive partnership with 
Congress. After a gap of 8 years, the Administration reestablished 
majority support in the Congress for trade liberalization by passing 
Trade Promotion Authority and the other market opening measures for 
developing countries in the Trade Act of 2002. This Administration will 
work with Congress to enact new bilateral, regional, and global trade 
agreements that will be concluded under the recently passed Trade 
Promotion Authority.*	Promote the connection between trade and development. Trade 
policies can help developing countries strengthen property rights, 
competition, the rule of law, investment, the spread of knowledge, open 
societies, the efficient allocation of resources, and regional 
integration -- all leading to growth, opportunity, and confidence in 
developing countries. The United States is implementing The Africa 
Growth and Opportunity Act to provide market-access for nearly all goods 
produced in the 35 countries of sub-Saharan Africa. We will make more 
use of this act and its equivalent for the Caribbean Basin and continue 
to work with multilateral and regional institutions to help poorer 
countries take advantage of these opportunities. Beyond market access, 
the most important area where trade intersects with poverty is in public 
health. We will ensure that the WTO intellectual property rules are 
flexible enough to allow developing nations to gain access to critical 
medicines for extraordinary dangers like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and 
malaria.*	Enforce trade agreements and laws against unfair practices. 
Commerce depends on the rule of law, international trade depends on 
enforceable agreements. Our top priorities are to resolve ongoing 
disputes with the European Union, Canada, and Mexico and to make a 
global effort to address new technology, science, and health regulations 
that needlessly impede farm exports and improved agriculture. Laws 
against unfair trade practices are often abused, but the international 
community must be able to address genuine concerns about government 
subsidies and dumping. International industrial espionage which 
undermines fair competition must be detected and deterred.*	Help domestic industries and workers adjust. There is a sound 
statutory framework for these transitional safeguards which we have used 
in the agricultural sector and which we are using this year to help the 
American steel industry. The benefits of free trade depend upon the 
enforcement of fair trading practices. These safeguards help ensure that 
the benefits of free trade do not come at the expense of American 
workers. Trade adjustment assistance will help workers adapt to the 
change and dynamism of open markets.*	Protect the environment and workers. The United States must foster 
economic growth in ways that will provide a better life along with 
widening prosperity. We will incorporate labor and environmental 
concerns into U.S. trade negotiations, creating a healthy network 
between multilateral environmental agreements with the WTO, and use the 
International Labor Organization, trade preference programs, and trade 
talks to improve working conditions in conjunction with freer trade.*	Enhance energy security. We will strengthen our own energy security 
and the shared prosperity of the global economy by working with our 
allies, trading partners, and energy producers to expand the sources and 
types of global energy supplied, especially in the Western Hemisphere, 
Africa, Central Asia, and the Caspian region. We will also continue to 
work with our partners to develop cleaner and more energy efficient 
technologies.
Economic growth should be accompanied by global efforts to stabilize 
greenhouse gas concentrations associated with this growth, containing 
them at a level that prevents dangerous human interference with the 
global climate. Our overall objective is to reduce America's greenhouse 
gas emissions relative to the size of our economy, cutting such 
emissions per unit of economic activity by 18 percent over the next 10 
years, by the year 2012. Our strategies for attaining this goal will be 
to:*	remain committed to the basic U.N. Framework Convention for 
international cooperation,*	obtain agreements with key industries to cut emissions of some of 
the most potent greenhouse gases and give transferable credits to 
companies that can show real cuts,*	develop improved standards for measuring and registering emission 
reductions,*	promote renewable energy production and clean coal technology, as 
well as nuclear power -- which produces no greenhouse gas emissions, 
while also improving fuel economy for U.S. cars and trucks,*	increase spending on research and new conservation technologies, to 
a total of $4.5 billion -- the largest sum being spent on climate change 
by any country in the world and a $700 million increase over last year's 
budget, and*	assist developing countries, especially the major greenhouse gas 
emitters such as China and India, so that they will have the tools and 
resources to join this effort and be able to grow along a cleaner and 
better path.
VII. Expand the Circle of Development by Opening Societies and Building 
the Infrastructure of Democracy
In World War II we fought to make the world safer, then worked to 
rebuild it. As we wage war today to keep the world safe from terror, we 
must also work to make the world a better place for all its citizens.President Bush
Washington, D.C. (Inter-American
Development Bank)
March 14, 2002A world where some live in comfort and plenty, while half of the human 
race lives on less than $2 a day, is neither just nor stable. Including 
all of the world's poor in an expanding circle of development -- and 
opportunity -- is a moral imperative and one of the top priorities of 
U.S. international policy.Decades of massive development assistance have failed to spur economic 
growth in the poorest countries. Worse, development aid has often served 
to prop up failed policies, relieving the pressure for reform and 
perpetuating misery. Results of aid are typically measured in dollars 
spent by donors, not in the rates of growth and poverty reduction 
achieved by recipients. These are the indicators of a failed strategy.Working with other nations, the United States is confronting this 
failure. We forged a new consensus at the U.N. Conference on Financing 
for Development in Monterrey that the objectives of assistance -- and 
the strategies to achieve those objectives -- must change.This Administration's goal is to help unleash the productive potential 
of individuals in all nations. Sustained growth and poverty reduction is 
impossible without the right national policies. Where governments have 
implemented real policy changes we will provide significant new levels 
of assistance. The United States and other developed countries should 
set an ambitious and specific target: to double the size of the world's 
poorest economies within a decade.The United States Government will pursue these major strategies to 
achieve this goal:*	Provide resources to aid countries that have met the challenge of 
national reform. We propose a 50 percent increase in the core 
development assistance given by the United States. While continuing our 
present programs, including humanitarian assistance based on need alone, 
these billions of new dollars will form a new Millennium Challenge 
Account for projects in countries whose governments rule justly, invest 
in their people, and encourage economic freedom. Governments must fight 
corruption, respect basic human rights, embrace the rule of law, invest 
in health care and education, follow responsible economic policies, and 
enable entrepreneurship. The Millennium Challenge Account will reward 
countries that have demonstrated real policy change and challenge those 
that have not to implement reforms.*	Improve the effectiveness of the World Bank and other development 
banks in raising living standards. The United States is committed to a 
comprehensive reform agenda for making the World Bank and the other 
multilateral development banks more effective in improving the lives of 
the world's poor. We have reversed the downward trend in U.S. 
contributions and proposed an 18 percent increase in the U.S. 
contributions to the International Development Association (IDA) -- the 
World Bank's fund for the poorest countries -- and the African 
Development Fund. The key to raising living standards and reducing 
poverty around the world is increasing productivity growth, especially 
in the poorest countries. We will continue to press the multilateral 
development banks to focus on activities that increase economic 
productivity, such as improvements in education, health, rule of law, 
and private sector development. Every project, every loan, every grant 
must be judged by how much it will increase productivity growth in 
developing countries.*	Insist upon measurable results to ensure that development 
assistance is actually making a difference in the lives of the world's 
poor. When it comes to economic development, what really matters is that 
more children are getting a better education, more people have access to 
health care and clean water, or more workers can find jobs to make a 
better future for their families. We have a moral obligation to measure 
the success of our development assistance by whether it is delivering 
results. For this reason, we will continue to demand that our own 
development assistance as well as assistance from the multilateral 
development banks has measurable goals and concrete benchmarks for 
achieving those goals. Thanks to U.S. leadership, the recent IDA 
replenishment agreement will establish a monitoring and evaluation 
system that measures recipient countries' progress. For the first time, 
donors can link a portion of their contributions to IDA to the 
achievement of actual development results, and part of the U.S. 
contribution is linked in this way. We will strive to make sure that the 
World Bank and other multilateral development banks build on this 
progress so that a focus on results is an integral part of everything 
that these institutions do.*	Increase the amount of development assistance that is provided in 
the form of grants instead of loans. Greater use of results-based grants 
is the best way to help poor countries make productive investments, 
particularly in the social sectors, without saddling them with 
ever-larger debt burdens. As a result of U.S. leadership, the recent IDA 
agreement provided for significant increases in grant funding for the 
poorest countries for education, HIV/AIDS, health, nutrition, water, 
sanitation, and other human needs. Our goal is to build on that progress 
by increasing the use of grants at the other multilateral development 
banks. We will also challenge universities, nonprofits, and the private 
sector to match government efforts by using grants to support 
development projects that show results.*	Open societies to commerce and investment. Trade and investment are 
the real engines of economic growth. Even if government aid increases, 
most money for development must come from trade, domestic capital, and 
foreign investment. An effective strategy must try to expand these flows 
as well. Free markets and free trade are key priorities of our national 
security strategy.*	Secure public health. The scale of the public health crisis in poor 
countries is enormous. In countries afflicted by epidemics and pandemics 
like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, growth and development will be 
threatened until these scourges can be contained. Resources from the 
developed world are necessary but will be effective only with honest 
governance, which supports prevention programs and provides effective 
local infrastructure. The United States has strongly backed the new 
global fund for HIV/AIDS organized by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan 
and its focus on combining prevention with a broad strategy for 
treatment and care. The United States already contributes more than 
twice as much money to such efforts as the next largest donor. If the 
global fund demonstrates its promise, we will be ready to give even more.*	Emphasize education. Literacy and learning are the foundation of 
democracy and development. Only about 7 percent of World Bank resources 
are devoted to education. This proportion should grow. The United States 
will increase its own funding for education assistance by at least 20 
percent with an emphasis on improving basic education and teacher 
training in Africa. The United States can also bring information 
technology to these societies, many of whose education systems have been 
devastated by AIDS.*	Continue to aid agricultural development. New technologies, 
including biotechnology, have enormous potential to improve crop yields 
in developing countries while using fewer pesticides and less water. 
Using sound science, the United States should help bring these benefits 
to the 800 million people, including 300 million children, who still 
suffer from hunger and malnutrition.
VIII. Develop Agendas for Cooperative Action with the Other Main Centers 
of Global Power
We have our best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the 17th 
century to build a world where the great powers compete in peace instead 
of prepare for war.President Bush
West Point, New York
June 1, 2002America will implement its strategies by organizing coalitions -- as 
broad as practicable -- of states able and willing to promote a balance 
of power that favors freedom. Effective coalition leadership requires 
clear priorities, an appreciation of others' interests, and consistent 
consultations among partners with a spirit of humility.There is little of lasting consequence that the United States can 
accomplish in the world without the sustained cooperation of its allies 
and friends in Canada and Europe. Europe is also the seat of two of the 
strongest and most able international institutions in the world: the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which has, since its 
inception, been the fulcrum of transatlantic and inter-European 
security, and the European Union (EU), our partner in opening world 
trade.The attacks of September 11 were also an attack on NATO, as NATO itself 
recognized when it invoked its Article V self-defense clause for the 
first time. NATO's core mission -- collective defense of the 
transatlantic alliance of democracies -- remains, but NATO must develop 
new structures and capabilities to carry out that mission under new 
circumstances. NATO must build a capability to field, at short notice, 
highly mobile, specially trained forces whenever they are needed to 
respond to a threat against any member of the alliance.The alliance must be able to act wherever our interests are threatened, 
creating coalitions under NATO's own mandate, as well as contributing to 
mission-based coalitions. To achieve this, we must:*	expand NATO's membership to those democratic nations willing and 
able to share the burden of defending and advancing our common interests,*	ensure that the military forces of NATO nations have appropriate 
combat contributions to make in coalition warfare,*	develop planning processes to enable those contributions to become 
effective multinational fighting forces,*	take advantage of the technological opportunities and economies of 
scale in our defense spending to transform NATO military forces so that 
they dominate potential aggressors and diminish our vulnerabilities,*	streamline and increase the flexibility of command structures to 
meet new operational demands and the associated requirements of 
training, integrating, and experimenting with new force configurations, 
and*	maintain the ability to work and fight together as allies even as 
we take the necessary steps to transform and modernize our forces.
If NATO succeeds in enacting these changes, the rewards will be a 
partnership as central to the security and interests of its member 
states as was the case during the Cold War. We will sustain a common 
perspective on the threats to our societies and improve our ability to 
take common action in defense of our nations and their interests. At the 
same time, we welcome our European allies' efforts to forge a greater 
foreign policy and defense identity with the EU, and commit ourselves to 
close consultations to ensure that these developments work with NATO. We 
cannot afford to lose this opportunity to better prepare the family of 
transatlantic democracies for the challenges to come.The attacks of September 11 energized America's Asian alliances. 
Australia invoked the ANZUS Treaty to declare the September 11 was an 
attack on Australia itself, following that historic decision with the 
dispatch of some of the world's finest combat forces for Operation 
Enduring Freedom. Japan and the Republic of Korea provided unprecedented 
levels of military logistical support within weeks of the terrorist 
attack. We have deepened cooperation on counter-terrorism with our 
alliance partners in Thailand and the Philippines and received 
invaluable assistance from close friends like Singapore and New Zealand.The war against terrorism has proven that America's alliances in Asia 
not only underpin regional peace and stability, but are flexible and 
ready to deal with new challenges. To enhance our Asian alliances and 
friendships, we will:
*	look to Japan to continue forging a leading role in regional and 
global affairs based on our common interests, our common values, and our 
close defense and diplomatic cooperation,*	work with South Korea to maintain vigilance towards the North while 
preparing our alliance to make contributions to the broader stability of 
the region over the longer-term,*	build on 50 years of U.S.-Australian alliance cooperation as we 
continue working together to resolve regional and global problems -- as 
we have so many times from the Battle of Leyte Gulf to Tora Bora,*	maintain forces in the region that reflect our commitments to our 
allies, our requirements, our technological advances, and the strategic 
environment, and*	build on stability provided by these alliances, as well as with 
institutions such as ASEAN and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
forum, to develop a mix of regional and bilateral strategies to manage 
change in this dynamic region.
We are attentive to the possible renewal of old patterns of great power 
competition. Several potential great powers are now in the midst of 
internal transition -- most importantly Russia, India, and China. In all 
three cases, recent developments have encouraged our hope that a truly 
global consensus about basic principles is slowly taking shape.With Russia, we are already building a new strategic relationship based 
on a central reality of the twenty-first century: the United States and 
Russia are no longer strategic adversaries. The Moscow Treaty on 
Strategic Reductions is emblematic of this new reality and reflects a 
critical change in Russian thinking that promises to lead to productive, 
long-term relations with the Euro-Atlantic community and the United 
States. Russia's top leaders have a realistic assessment of their 
country's current weakness and the policies -- internal and external -- 
needed to reverse those weaknesses. They understand, increasingly, that 
Cold War approaches do not serve their national interests and that 
Russian and American strategic interests overlap in many areas.United States policy seeks to use this turn in Russian thinking to 
refocus our relationship on emerging and potential common interests and 
challenges. We are broadening our already extensive cooperation in the 
global war on terrorism. We are facilitating Russia's entry into the 
World Trade Organization, without lowering standards for accession, to 
promote beneficial bilateral trade and investment relations. We have 
created the NATO-Russia Council with the goal of deepening security 
cooperation among Russia, our European allies, and ourselves. We will 
continue to bolster the independence and stability of the states of the 
former Soviet Union in the belief that a prosperous and stable 
neighborhood will reinforce Russia's growing commitment to integration 
into the Euro-Atlantic community.At the same time, we are realistic about the differences that still 
divide us from Russia and about the time and effort it will take to 
build an enduring strategic partnership. Lingering distrust of our 
motives and policies by key Russian elites slows improvement in our 
relations. Russia's uneven commitment to the basic values of free-market 
democracy and dubious record in combating the proliferation of weapons 
of mass destruction remain matters of great concern. Russia's very 
weakness limits the opportunities for cooperation. Nevertheless, those 
opportunities are vastly greater now than in recent years -- or even 
decades.The United States has undertaken a transformation in its bilateral 
relationship with India based on a conviction that U.S. interests 
require a strong relationship with India. We are the two largest 
democracies, committed to political freedom protected by representative 
government. India is moving toward greater economic freedom as well. We 
have a common interest in the free flow of commerce, including through 
the vital sea lanes of the Indian Ocean. Finally, we share an interest 
in fighting terrorism and in creating a strategically stable Asia.Differences remain, including over the development of India's nuclear 
and missile programs, and the pace of India's economic reforms. But 
while in the past these concerns may have dominated our thinking about 
India, today we start with a view of India as a growing world power with 
which we have common strategic interests. Through a strong partnership 
with India, we can best address any differences and shape a dynamic 
future.The United States relationship with China is an important part of our 
strategy to promote a stable, peaceful, and prosperous Asia-Pacific 
region. We welcome the emergence of a strong, peaceful, and prosperous 
China. The democratic development of China is crucial to that future. 
Yet, a quarter century after beginning the process of shedding the worst 
features of the Communist legacy, China's leaders have not yet made the 
next series of fundamental choices about the character of their state. 
In pursuing advanced military capabilities that can threaten its 
neighbors in the Asia-Pacific region, China is following an outdated 
path that, in the end, will hamper its own pursuit of national 
greatness. In time, China will find that social and political freedom is 
the only source of that greatness.The United States seeks a constructive relationship with a changing 
China. We already cooperate well where our interests overlap, including 
the current war on terrorism and in promoting stability on the Korean 
peninsula. Likewise, we have coordinated on the future of Afghanistan 
and have initiated a comprehensive dialogue on counter-terrorism and 
similar transitional concerns. Shared health and environmental threats, 
such as the spread of HIV/AIDS, challenge us to promote jointly the 
welfare of our citizens.Addressing these transnational threats will challenge China to become 
more open with information, promote the development of civil society, 
and enhance individual human rights. China has begun to take the road to 
political openness, permitting many personal freedoms and conducting 
village-level elections, yet remains strongly committed to national 
one-party rule by the Communist Party. To make that nation truly 
accountable to its citizen's needs and aspirations, however, much work 
remains to be done. Only by allowing the Chinese people to think, 
assemble, and worship freely can China reach its full potential.Our important trade relationship will benefit from China's entry into 
the World Trade Organization, which will create more export 
opportunities and ultimately more jobs for American farmers, workers, 
and companies. China is our fourth largest trading partner, with over 
$100 billion in annual two-way trade. The power of market principles and 
the WTO's requirements for transparency and accountability will advance 
openness and the rule of law in China to help establish basic 
protections for commerce and for citizens. There are, however, other 
areas in which we have profound disagreements. Our commitment to the 
self-defense of Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act is one. Human 
rights is another. We expect China to adhere to its nonproliferation 
commitments. We will work to narrow differences where they exist, but 
not allow them to preclude cooperation where we agree.The events of September 11, 2001, fundamentally changed the context for 
relations between the United States and other main centers of global 
power, and opened vast, new opportunities. With our long-standing allies 
in Europe and Asia, and with leaders in Russia, India, and China, we 
must develop active agendas of cooperation lest these relationships 
become routine and unproductive.Every agency of the United States Government shares the challenge. We 
can build fruitful habits of consultation, quiet argument, sober 
analysis, and common action. In the long-term, these are the practices 
that will sustain the supremacy of our common principles and keep open 
the path of progress.IX. Transform America's National Security Institutions to Meet the 
Challenges and Opportunities of the Twenty-First Century
Terrorists attacked a symbol of American prosperity. They did not touch 
its source. America is successful because of the hard work, creativity, 
and enterprise of our people.President Bush
Washington, D.C. (Joint Session of Congress)
September 20, 2001The major institutions of American national security were designed in a 
different era to meet different requirements. All of them must be 
transformed.It is time to reaffirm the essential role of American military strength. 
We must build and maintain our defenses beyond challenge. Our military's 
highest priority is to defend the United States. To do so effectively, 
our military must:*	assure our allies and friends,*	dissuade future military competition,*	deter threats against U.S. interests, allies, and friends, and*	decisively defeat any adversary if deterrence fails.
The unparalleled strength of the United States armed forces, and their 
forward presence, have maintained the peace in some of the world's most 
strategically vital regions. However, the threats and enemies we must 
confront have changed, and so must our forces. A military structured to 
deter massive Cold War-era armies must be transformed to focus more on 
how an adversary might fight rather than where and when a war might 
occur. We will channel our energies to overcome a host of operational 
challenges.The presence of American forces overseas is one of the most profound 
symbols of the U.S. commitments to allies and friends. Through our 
willingness to use force in our own defense and in defense of others, 
the United States demonstrates its resolve to maintain a balance of 
power that favors freedom. To contend with uncertainty and to meet the 
many security challenges we face, the United States will require bases 
and stations within and beyond Western Europe and Northeast Asia, as 
well as temporary access arrangements for the long-distance deployment 
of U.S. forces.Before the war in Afghanistan, that area was low on the list of major 
planning contingencies. Yet, in a very short time, we had to operate 
across the length and breadth of that remote nation, using every branch 
of the armed forces. We must prepare for more such deployments by 
developing assets such as advanced remote sensing, long-range precision 
strike capabilities, and transformed maneuver and expeditionary forces. 
This broad portfolio of military capabilities must also include the 
ability to defend the homeland, conduct information operations, ensure 
U.S. access to distant theaters, and protect critical U.S. 
infrastructure and assets in outer space.Innovation within the armed forces will rest on experimentation with new 
approaches to warfare, strengthening joint operations, exploiting U.S. 
intelligence advantages, and taking full advantage of science and 
technology. We must also transform the way the Department of Defense is 
run, especially in financial management and recruitment and retention. 
Finally, while maintaining near-term readiness and the ability to fight 
the war on terrorism, the goal must be to provide the President with a 
wider range of military options to discourage aggression or any form of 
coercion against the United States, our allies, and our friends.We know from history that deterrence can fail, and we know from 
experience that some enemies cannot be deterred. The United States must 
and will maintain the capability to defeat any attempt by an enemy -- 
whether a state or non-state actor -- to impose its will on the United 
States, our allies, or our friends. We will maintain the forces 
sufficient to support our obligations, and to defend freedom. Our forces 
will be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a 
military build-up in hopes of surpassing, or equaling, the power of the 
United States.Intelligence -- and how we use it -- is our first line of defense 
against terrorists and the threat posed by hostile states. Designed 
around the priority of gathering enormous information about a massive, 
fixed object -- the Soviet bloc -- the intelligence community is coping 
with the challenge of following a far more complex and elusive set of 
targets.We must transform our intelligence capabilities and build new ones to 
keep pace with the nature of these threats. Intelligence must be 
appropriately integrated with our defense and law enforcement systems 
and coordinated with our allies and friends. We need to protect the 
capabilities we have so that we do not arm our enemies with the 
knowledge of how best to surprise us. Those who would harm us also seek 
the benefit of surprise to limit our prevention and response options and 
to maximize injury.We must strengthen intelligence warning and analysis to provide 
integrated threat assessments for national and homeland security. Since 
the threats inspired by foreign governments and groups may be conducted 
inside the United States, we must also ensure the proper fusion of 
information between intelligence and law enforcement.Initiatives in this area will include:*	strengthening the authority of the Director of Central Intelligence 
to lead the development and actions of the Nation's foreign intelligence 
capabilities,*	establishing a new framework for intelligence warning that provides 
seamless and integrated warning across the spectrum of threats facing 
the nation and our allies,*	continuing to develop new methods of collecting information to 
sustain our intelligence advantage,*	investing in future capabilities while working to protect them 
through a more vigorous effort to prevent the compromise of intelligence 
capabilities, and*	collecting intelligence against the terrorist danger across the 
government with all-source analysis.
As the United States Government relies on the armed forces to defend 
America's interests, it must rely on diplomacy to interact with other 
nations. We will ensure that the Department of State receives funding 
sufficient to ensure the success of American diplomacy. The State 
Department takes the lead in managing our bilateral relationships with 
other governments. And in this new era, its people and institutions must 
be able to interact equally adroitly with non-governmental organizations 
and international institutions. Officials trained mainly in 
international politics must also extend their reach to understand 
complex issues of domestic governance around the world, including public 
health, education, law enforcement, the judiciary, and public diplomacy.Our diplomats serve at the front line of complex negotiations, civil 
wars, and other humanitarian catastrophes. As humanitarian relief 
requirements are better understood, we must also be able to help build 
police forces, court systems, and legal codes, local and provincial 
government institutions, and electoral systems. Effective international 
cooperation is needed to accomplish these goals, backed by American 
readiness to play our part.Just as our diplomatic institutions must adapt so that we can reach out 
to others, we also need a different and more comprehensive approach to 
public information efforts that can help people around the world learn 
about and understand America. The war on terrorism is not a clash of 
civilizations. It does, however, reveal the clash inside a civilization, 
a battle for the future of the Muslim world. This is a struggle of ideas 
and this is an area where America must excel.We will take the actions necessary to ensure that our efforts to meet 
our global security commitments and protect Americans are not impaired 
by the potential for investigations, inquiry, or prosecution by the 
International Criminal Court (ICC), whose jurisdiction does not extend 
to Americans and which we do not accept. We will work together with 
other nations to avoid complications in our military operations and 
cooperation, through such mechanisms as multilateral and bilateral 
agreements that will protect U.S. nationals from the ICC. We will 
implement fully the American Servicemembers Protection Act, whose 
provisions are intended to ensure and enhance the protection of U.S. 
personnel and officials.We will make hard choices in the coming year and beyond to ensure the 
right level and allocation of government spending on national security. 
The United States Government must strengthen its defenses to win this 
war. At home, our most important priority is to protect the homeland for 
the American people.Today, the distinction between domestic and foreign affairs is 
diminishing. In a globalized world, events beyond America's borders have 
a greater impact inside them. Our society must be open to people, ideas, 
and goods from across the globe. The characteristics we most cherish -- 
our freedom, our cities, our systems of movement, and modern life -- are 
vulnerable to terrorism. This vulnerability will persist long after we 
bring to justice those responsible for the September eleventh attacks. 
As time passes, individuals may gain access to means of destruction that 
until now could be wielded only by armies, fleets, and squadrons. This 
is a new condition of life. We will adjust to it and thrive -- in spite 
of it.In exercising our leadership, we will respect the values, judgment, and 
interests of our friends and partners. Still, we will be prepared to act 
apart when our interests and unique responsibilities require. When we 
disagree on particulars, we will explain forthrightly the grounds for 
our concerns and strive to forge viable alternatives. We will not allow 
such disagreements to obscure our determination to secure together, with 
our allies and our friends, our shared fundamental interests and values.Ultimately, the foundation of American strength is at home. It is in the 
skills of our people, the dynamism of our economy, and the resilience of 
our institutions. A diverse, modern society has inherent, ambitious, 
entrepreneurial energy. Our strength comes from what we do with that 
energy. That is where our national security begins.

Sure it is - it tends to bring out the people who let hysterical
right wing propaganda spew forth, while reaching for their gun 
whenever a liberal enters the room.my hysterical left wing propaganda is generally an emotional
reaction on a mailing list, not an organizaed attempt at converting
people's thinking through lies and distortion (as was the original
article). Whereas your constant and predictable brandings of my postings are, to
 my mind, a deliberate and reasoned  effort to reduce debate, and
 discourage left of center postngs. Owen

natural in talks with enron over portland utility by wall street journal staff reporters robin sidel , rebecca smith and nikhil deogun 10 / 05 / 2001 the wall street journal b 2 ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) enron corp . is in advanced discussions to sell its portland general electric utility unit to northwest natural gas co . for about $ 1 . 8 billion in cash and stock in a highly leveraged transaction that would eventually give enron a minority stake in northwest , according to people familiar with the matter . the discussions are at a very delicate stage , and some important points need to be finalized , these people caution . the current environment could also make financing such a transaction quite difficult , and board approval isn ' t a certainty . however , should the two sides agree to terms , a deal could be announced in the next few days . northwest natural is also expected to assume roughly $ 1 billion in debt . enron and northwest natural declined to comment . if a transaction is consummated , it would come nearly six months after the collapse of enron ' s agreement to sell the utility to sierra pacific resources . that transaction fell apart in part because of the california energy crisis . a purchase of portland general would be a very big bite for northwest natural , which has a market capitalization of just $ 650 million and supplies natural gas to more than 500 , 000 residential and business customers in oregon and vancouver , wash . portland general is an electric utility serving more than 1 . 4 million customers in oregon . the deal would bring together two oregon utilities whose executives and employees know each other well . richard g . reiten , northwest ' s chairman and chief executive , was president and chief operating officer of portland general between 1989 and 1996 , and also served on its board . by buying a utility , northwest would hope to have more bargaining power in its gas purchases , enabling it to buy more product and store it when prices are cheap . a deal would be accretive to northwest ' s earnings , people familiar with the matter say . and the financial risk for northwest natural is somewhat muted because enron is helping to facilitate and finance the transaction by agreeing to take common stock and convertible preferred stock in northwest natural in addition to cash . northwest natural would finance the transaction with debt and equity offerings . shares of northwest natural were trading up $ 1 . 04 at $ 25 . 99 in 4 p . m . composite trading on the new york stock exchange , while enron stock was down 39 cents a share at $ 33 . 10 . for enron , a deal with northwest natural would be the latest twist in a five - year ordeal that was supposed to help the nation ' s biggest energy trader break into california ' s deregulating electricity market . but the utility business proved less valuable than anticipated when enron was prevented from selling off utility contracts that enabled it to buy electricity cheaply . and california ' s market developed serious problems last year that made it a less attractive place for enron to do business . enron , which also owns a major gas - transmission pipeline system , has a history of buying assets and businesses , learning what it can from them , and then selling off the bulk of physical assets so it can reinvest capital elsewhere . it isn ' t clear where enron will put the capital to work that it garners from the sale . its broadband telecommunications business is in the doldrums and it recently said it would invest $ 250 million in it this year , down from a formerly projected $ 750 million .;Safe Email

963;el paso articles today - ngi note : the following 3 articles deal with 3 different issues : lst - - marketing related 2 nd - operations / marketing related 3 rd - legislative / regulatory related el paso explosion takes 500 mmcf / d off market about 1 bcf / d of flow on el paso ' s south mainline downstream of pecos river ( nm ) station ceased after the pipeline exploded early saturday , killing 10 people and seriously injuring two others at a nearby campsite . el paso said monday it was able to compensate for about half that volume through a combination of fuel switching by downstream customers , maximum storage withdrawals , an ofo and other customer cooperation . the market reaction was rather predictable as all three california points rose by about 35 cents to lead an overall price surge . however , utilities in the state did not appear to be experiencing any supply problems . socal gas said storage and supplies from other southwest receipt points were adequate to avoid any problems . a gas operations official for los angeles dept . of water and power also saw no reason for panic . from past similar incidents on southwest pipelines , he expected that the approximately 80 - feet - long section missing from el paso ' s line could be  slapped back into place rather quickly .  el paso itself had no estimate for when it can restore service in the impacted segment , it must get approval rom the federal investigators before beginning repairs or evaluating a restart of the adjacent lines . but a large aggregator and a marketer agreed with the ladwp official that it should be  a quick mechanical fix  once repairs begin . the aggregator believed downtime could be as short as a week . no customers were cut off as a result of the rupture but some were getting reduced volumes , an el paso spokeswoman said . northern natural gas was seeing a throughput increase of 200 - 300 mmcf / d monday while transwestern volumes were up 50 - 75 mmcf / d as a result of shippers diverting gas away from el paso ' s south mainline , an enron spokeswoman said . a producer said she diverted as much of her company ' s gas as possible from el paso to transwestern . people were reluctant to trade permian basin gas monday , especially at fixed prices , because of doubts about how much would be able to flow , several sources said . permian numbers rose a little less than 18 cents as part of the general upturn . however , it was waha prices that saw a bigger increase of nearly 30 cents as a result .  everything in el paso - permian ' s keystone pool was going back into waha ,  said a marketer , putting waha in the mid $ 4 . 60 s at a premium of more than a nickel above henry hub . the southern california border , at an average of nearly $ 5 . 30 , led the rest of monday ' s market by a large margin . before trading began , enrononline was offering border swing swaps for the rest of the month at $ 5 . 85 - 95 , a marketer said . with swing swaps priced so high , it gave sellers more confidence in what prices they could command in the day market , he said .  either way , i wouldn ' t want to be short right now at the border .  there were lots of rumors but no facts available on what caused the el paso rupture , noted one aggregator .  but it ' s a good thing it didn ' t happen until after california had cooled off . otherwise i could easily have seen the border basis spread from san juan basin go as high as $ 2 . 50  instead of the approximate gap of $ 1 . 70 egistered monday by daily gpi . a knowledgeable source provided his analyis of the blast : the structure of the crater made the rupture  look like a line integrity problem from the way it blew out .  the earth can harbor leaking gas for a while until eventually everything all goes up at once . people nearby would not have detected anything because gas is odorless in long - haul lines , the mercaptan odorant is not added until it gets to the local distribution stage . pipeline safety surveyors usually will look for dead vegetation in the vicinity to detect a leak , but this was a desert area with very little vegetation . it is easily possible for escaping gas to hug the ground for the approximate 500 - foot distance to the victims ' campsite and seek an ignition source there . it is a normal tendency for gas leaking into the atmosphere to stay close to the ground , and that tendency would have been amplied by the chilliness of the pre - dawn desert . the source went on to say ,  i think there will be lot more of this [ ruptures ] in the future with many pipes becoming at least 40 - 50 years old .  el paso was unlucky in experiencing one of the early incidents , he said , because the situation applies to the other lines with old pipe . pipelines used to spend a lot more money on maintenance when regulation was tighter and they were still paying for depreciation , he said .  now they ' re more purely for - profit companies after having written off their [ depreciation ] costs many times over .  el paso blast kills 10 , shuts down south mainline federal and company investigators monday swarmed over the scene of the devastating el paso natural gas mainline explosion that erupted near daybreak saturday , engulfing a party of weekend campers along the pecos river near carlsbad , nm , and killing 10 people . two other persons were hospitalized in critical condition . three officials from the federal office of pipeline safety ( ops ) and 11 with the national transportation safety board ( ntsb ) have been at the site of the blast since late saturday , and two more ops officials were en route monday . new mexico gov . gary johnson , who flew to the area on sunday , said he wanted to know how many other potential pipeline  dangers  there are in the state . he called for a thorough investigation . about 1 bcf / d of capacity on el paso ' s southern leg initially was lost from the ruptured 30 - inch line and two looped lines nearby that were shut in after the accident . el paso was making up some of the shortfall by drawing the maximum , 200 mmcf / d from its washington ranch storage field downstream of the accident . increased use of other pipelines , allocations and cutbacks by customers , and the fact that weather had moderated in california helped ease the supply situation . nevertheless , spot prices increased by about 35 cents for points in california , while the rest of the market ( spurred by hurricane debby ) went up about 20 cents . there was no estimate as to when the looped lines would be back in service , according to el paso spokesperson kim wallace .  we don ' t intend to put anything back into service until we know for certain that the remaining pipelines are safe ,  wallace said . she did not expect them to be back in service today , and could give no time frame on when they would be returned to service . it is  much too premature at this point  to predict when the three disabled el paso westbound lines will return to service , said patricia klinger , a spokeswoman with the department of transportation ' s research and special programs administration ( rspa ) , which oversees the ops .  the one that ruptured is definitely going to be out of service for awhile , and [ another line ] is badly damaged from the fire .  as for a third adjacent line , that  could potentially be re - opened ,  but  we have to test the integrity of that line  and have it examined by metallurgists , she told daily gpi .  everyone will be working , of course , to try to get this [ line ] back in service . but the safe operation of the pipeline is of premiere importance .  the three lines shared the same right - of - way .  we ' re just now able to start looking at exactly what happened , and how to get that one line back in service ,  klinger said .  our metallurgist is on his way right now . i know he ' s going to meet with the ntsb when they ' re examining the 50 - foot section of pipe that ' s out of the ground  as a result of the explosion .  i think the company also wants to decide what types of tests can be done on this line . it ' s not piggable .  the ntsb , which has set up a command center in carlsbad , nm , declined to make any preliminary speculation about the cause of the explosion .  it ' s much too early for us to even think about the cause of this accident . we ' re only dealing with the facts . . . right now , we ' re documenting the pipe itself and surveying the land . we ' re going to look at the chronology of when the [ emergency ] calls came in . . . . . document damage to vehicles , and injuries ,  said ntsb spokesman keith holloway .  probably at this point we ' re looking at nine months to a year , maybe more  before the results of the investigation are publicly disclosed , holloway noted . the rupture occurred at 5 : 30 a . m . mdt in the underground line near the pecos river crossing , which is about 30 miles south of the carlsbad caverns national park in a spot popular with local campers and fishermen . the blast tore a crater in the earth about 86 feet long , 46 feet wide and 20 feet deep . according to preliminary reports , the pipeline was underground at the point of rupture , sending two sections of pipe , each about 20 - feet long , flying hundreds of feet . the gas then ignited and shot flames from the broken pipe toward sleeping campers . the ntsb estimated there was a gap of 50 to 60 feet between broken ends of the pipeline at the site . the fire burned for about 40 minutes before el paso workers manually shut off pipeline valves . ten members of two families were burned to death in the blast . the families , who were related by marriage , were camping on public land along the river near where the pipeline emerged from the ground to cross the pecos in an aerial crossing alongside a bridge . six were pronounced dead at the scene and four others died at texas hospitals saturday night . the dead included five children under the age of six , including six - month - old twins . two adults were listed in critical condition monday at a hospital in lubbock , tx . the ruptured pipeline , which el paso said was constructed in 1950 , is one of four that runs along the southern branch of el paso ' s pipeline system . there is an adjacent 30 - inch pipeline and another 26 - inch pipeline . the fourth , a 16 - inch pipeline , was abandoned and is not available for service , wallace said . el paso and federal officials are particularly interested in the integrity of the second 30 - inch pipeline that ran close to the broken line . wallace said that none of the company ' s customers had been cut off of service , but they were receiving gas as reduced levels . she also said that on aug . 2 , a  patrol  inspection , either done by air or vehicle , was conducted on the pipelines located near the pecos river by el paso officials and no problems were found . el paso conducted the last corrosion test in february and no problems were found then either . visual inspections are conducted on all of the system ' s pipelines once a month , she said , and the company follows all federal pipeline requirements for inspections . asked whether el paso planned to change its inspection system immediately , wallace said that she did not think so , but said that if the ntsb review finds something that needs to be changed , the company will do whatever needs to be done immediately .  these situations are so rare ,  she said .  we don ' t feel that we need to change what we ' re doing now . but if the situation warrants , we certainly will make any changes necessary .  el paso is working with family members to take care of their immediate needs , including hotel accommodations , food , travel arrangements and medical treatment . the company also is providing additional services as needed .  this is a tragic accident and our heartfelt condolences go out to the families involved ,  said el paso energy president william wise . he said the company was working with the ntsb  to investigate diligently all matters surrounding this accident and to establish its cause as quickly as possible .  the fallout of the explosion is expected to extend all across the country , as federal legislators consider more stringent pipeline rules following an explosion in bellingham , wa , that killed three in june 1999 . locally , carlsbad mayor gary perkowski said that he wanted to find out what happened and keep it from ever happening again . that reaction was echoed by the new mexico governor .  i have a lot of questions ,  said johnson .  what is the reliability of these pipelines ? what went wrong ? was it preventable ?  meanwhile , rspa was sifting through its history to determine whether the el paso blast was the biggest pipeline disaster on record in terms of fatalities . timeline : 5 : 26 a . m . aug . 19 : el paso natural gas ' automated computer reading of the pressure in the pipeline indicates 673 . 5 pounds per square inch . around 5 : 30 a . m . : an el paso natural gas employee bow - hunting in the area sees a large fireball at the scene . 5 : 30 a . m . : el paso natural gas ' automated computer reading of the pressure in the pipeline drops to 377 . 19 pounds per square inch . 5 : 30 a . m . : carlsbad fire department responds to the emergency . 6 : 12 a . m . : carlsbad fire department arrives at the scene . 6 : 21 a . m . : el paso natural gas workers shut off the gas line using manual valves . between jan . 1 and june 30 of this year , there have been 40 transmission pipeline incidents , according to the ops . fourteen were caused by either external or internal corrosion , 11 were damaged by outside forces , three were due to construction or material defects , and 10 were unknown . there was only one fatality until june 30 of this year on transmission pipeline incidents , which was caused by an outside force . eleven people had been injured through june . in august 1999 , ops sent a warning letter to el paso , citing it for a number of pipeline safety violations in arizona . the ops did not impose a civil fine on el paso , but it advised the pipeline that  should you not correct the circumstances leading to the violation , we will take enforcement actions when and if the continued violation comes to our attention .  - - el paso blast may cinch tough pipe safety bill the explosion on el paso natural gas ' system , which killed 10 people over the weekend , may give congress the added boost to pass a tough pipeline safety reauthorization bill when it returns from recess in september , capitol hill insiders said monday .  this just sadly proves why congress needs to act as soon as it returns [ on sept . 5 ] to pass the pipeline safety improvement act before any more innocent lives are taken ,  said a spokeswoman for sen . john mccain ( r - az ) . in june , chairman mccain ' s senate commerce committee voted out the pipeline safety improvement bill that would , among other things , give states inspection and oversight authority over interstate pipelines , require interstate pipelines to consult with states about their integrity plans , create stiffer penalties for pipeline safety transgressors , and offer protection to whistle - blowers who report pipeline violations . mccain proposed the agressive safety bill following the product pipeline explosion in bellingham , wa , that killed three in june 1999 .  mccain has always been determined to pass this bill this year , but this obviously sadly strengthens that resolve ,  she said . he  will make a determined effort for this to happen ,  but whether it ' s brought up for a vote on the senate floor will be up to senate leader trent lott ( r - ms ) , the mccain spokeswoman said .  i have no doubts  that the senate will push for pipeline safety when it returns , said terry boss , vice president of environment , safety and operations for the interstate natural gas association of america ( ingaa ) . on the house side , a companion to mccain ' s bill has been introduced , as well as a number of other pipeline safety measures , but most are at the subcommittee level . but the issue could pick up steam in the wake of the el paso blast .  we must examine why this accident occurred and ensure that it must never happen again ,  said rep . joe skeen ( r - nm ) .  definitely it ' s a tragic situation ,  boss said , referring to the explosion near carlsbad , nm , which reportedly left a crater about 20 feet deep , 46 feet wide and 86 feet long . five of the 10 fatalities were children , who were spending a weekend camping and fishing with their family along the pecos river . the political fallout from the disaster was being assessed in washington d . c . yesterday .  any kind of incident has political ramifications . . . . . we ' re just not sure how this is going to ' directly impact '  pending legislation and regulations , boss noted .;Safe Email

972;lexical semantic tagging lexical semantic tagging a special issue of the journal of natural language engineering guest editors : marc light and martha palmer call for papers note : deadline for submissions is november 1st , 1998 computing semantic representations is crucial for many applications of natural language processing . currently , semantic lexicons and sets of semantic composition rules are hand-crafted by the designers of the nlp system . the difficulty of building such hand-crafted semantic knowledge bases has limited the field of nlp to applications that can be contained within well-defined subdomains . the likely escape from this limitation will come from the use of automated or semi-automated methods of lexical acquisition . however , the field has yet to develop a clear consensus on a computational lexicon that could provide a springboard for such methods . one of the most controversial areas has to do with polysemy : what constitutes a clear separation into senses of a word , and how can they be computationally characterized and distinguished ? the answer to this question is critical to breaking the bottleneck of broad coverage semantic representation computation . a first step towards finding an answer lies in acquiring annotated corpora that will facilitate the use of empirical methods . the topic of this special issue is tagging word tokens in corpora with lexical semantic information . a concrete example of such tagging would be specifying the sense of an ambiguous word , like { \ em bank } , being used in a particular sentence in a corpus . lexical semantic tagging is critical to extending reliable co-reference for information extraction tasks , to widening the scope of responses to information retrieval queries , to more robust dialogue understanding , and to machine translation . in machine translation in particular , it is often necessary to disambiguate a polysemous source word in order to translate it correctly , since the target language may have distinct lexical items for different senses . we solicit articles which either : ( i ) discuss the characteristics of information to be tagged and how human tagging ( hand-tagging ) can be performed so as to maximize accuracy . such articles should concentrate on the specification of the task and also deal with issues in providing sufficient quantities of accurate and diverse hand-tagged data for the automatic approaches . ( ii ) discuss attempts to develop automated methods and their operation and performance . these articles should describe actual running systems and their design and implementation . we are particularly interested in discussions of lexical semantic tagging methods which are part of actual applications . format : in the interest of providing more coverage , we will be considering papers that are somewhat shorter than traditional journal papers . this would allow us to accept a maximum of 9 articles given an average length of 10 pages . schedule : november 1st , 1998 : submission deadline february 15th , 1999 : notification of acceptance please send submissions to : martha palmer institute for research in cognitive science 400a , 3401 walnut street / 6228 university of pennsylvania philadlephia , pa 19104 telephone : ( 215 ) 898-0361 fax no . : ( 215 ) 573-9247 e-mail : mpalmer @ cis . upenn . edu;Safe Email

2-yr-old who figured out he could put it into a sidebar menu so all
he need do is click there to launch their favourite MP3 playlist.What /we/ need is a good barely literate email program.  Years ago
the university of Hawaii had a word processor that included a
voice-assist and also would pop up menus for common completions as
words were typed, even further back there was a DOS shareware editor
that did that latter function extremely well (targetted at the
handicapped).  With just those little bits of assists, maybe some
clever use of pictograms too, I bet kindergarten kids could handle

985;latex on pc 's last month i posted a query about latex on pcs . here 's a summary of the responses i got and my own experience in making my choice ( gtex ) work ( if you plan to adopt gtex , especially for windows nt , be sure to read my comments - - it will save you time . . . ) first , i 'd like to thank the following persons for proving , yet again , the power of the virtual community : alderson @ netcom . com ( richard m . alderson iii ) mark robert hale ( hale1 @ alcor . concordia . ca ) michael covington ( mcovingt @ ai . uga . edu ) stewart nichols ( nichols @ ccwf . cc . utexas . edu ) knappen @ vkpmzd . kph . uni -

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  you might want to check out the usenet group comp . tex . tex , and its faq . also , the book mking tex work , by norman walsh , from o'reilly associates .   you can also check out the tex archives on the us ctan site : ftp . shsu . edu .   the most comprehensive distribution is called 4alltex , it 's available at the standard ctan - archive sites ( like ftp . shsu . edu ) and on the cd - rom  snapshot  of same from prime time ( prime time texcetera ) .  special thanks to suying yang who sent a very useful page from walsh 's _ making tex work _ . here it is : tex and the other programs mentioned in this book are available from a number of places . it 's impossible to list all of the places where you might find any given tool , but there is one place where you will almost certainly find every tool : the comprehensive tex archive network ( ctan ) . this network is a fully-mirrored anonymous ftp hierarchy on three continents . always use the ftp site that is geographically closest to you . the following table lists the current members of ctan as of july 1993 : % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % location site ip address top level directory united states ftp . shsu . edu 192 . 92 . 115 . 10 / tex-archive england ftp . tex . ac . uk 131 . 151 . 79 . 32 / tex-archive germany ftp . uni-stuugart . de 129 . 69 . 8 . 13 / tex-archive % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % you may also access the ctan archives by electronic mail if you do not have ftp access . for up-to - date instructions about the mail server , send the single-line message help to : fileserv @ shsu . edu . where are the files ? every ctan mirror site has the same well-organized directory structure . the top-level directory also contains a complete catalog of current files organized by name , date , and size . the catalogs are named files . byname , files . bydate , and files . bysize , respectively , in the top level directory . the top-level directory contains the following subdirectories : % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % directory description of contents tools archiving tools ( unzip , tar , compress , etc . ) biblio tools for maintaining bibliographic databases digests electronic digests ( texhax , uktex , etc . ) info free documentation , many good guides dviware printing and previewing software fonts fonts fo tex graphics software for working with pictures and figures help online help files , etc . indexing indexing and glossary building tools language multi -

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - many have pointed out that i could run linux ( freely distributed unix clone ) on my pc , and that it has great tex support ( ntex 1 . 3 ) . this turned out to be impractical for me . but it is an option i did not know existed :  check out freebsd , freely downloadable from ftp . freebsd . org , or available as a cdrom from cdrom . com ( about $ 40 or less ) . you can maintain dos and unix on the same hardware and switch between the two , and therefore have your latex , too .  3 ) the commercial option : - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  there is a commercial version of ( la ) tex available for pcs from y&y , who just today have announced a sales-help @ yandy . com ( among other addresses ) .   re your linguist query - - we looked at the blurb describing both y&y tex and truetex and chose the former .  for info on truetex email richard j . kinch ( kinch @ netcom . com ) , for info on y&y tex email louis vosloo ( 71172 . 524 @ compuserve . com ) . both are in the $ 400 - - 500 area from memory . seemed to me that y&y tex was a bit more abreast of changes ( like latex 2e ) than truetex but you 'd be best to get info from both of course to make up your own mind .  4 ) latex on the mac - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  if you are not set on an intel - based processor , oztex 1 . 8 is the best shareware version for the mac , while textures ( from blue sky ) is a highly regarded commercial implementation .   i ' ve used textures for years on a mac and still have n't seen anything to compare in terms of ease of integration of graphics .  5 ) emtex - - - - - - - - - emtex seems to be the overall favorite for dos machines . it is said to be much more widely used ( than gtex ) and easier to install . a summary of how you can get it :  the most painless way to get latex on your pc is to download emtex from the university of georgia ( ai . uga . edu , / pub / emtex ) . we give additional installation instructions besides those provided by the author .  other cites : ftp . rus . uni-stuttgart . de / pub / tex / sytems / msdos / emtex and emtex-fonts ponder . csci . unt . edu [ 129 . 120 . 3 . 16 ] pub / tex / emtex ymir . claremont . edu [ 134 . 173 . 4 . 23 ] [ anonymous . tex . ibm _ pc . emtex ] there was also a particular enthusiastic endorsment of emtex for emacs users on os / 2 :  i use the os / 2 version [ of emtex ] which is truly excellent ( not being limited by memory , it is much better than the dos version ) . there are also available for os / 2 , a graphical dvi viewer ( dvipm ) , ghostscript , dvips , etc . in addition , em has ported gnu emacs to os / 2 ( the current version is 19 . 27 ) . imho , if you are going to work in latex , you should be using emacs in latex mode as your editor . emacs + emtex under os / 2 has pretty much supplanted other use of word processing software  6 ) gtex - - - - - - - - the gtex package was said to be more complete ( amslatex , amstex , dviwin etc . ) and more windows - friendly than emtex . this is , more or less , what sold me on it . i got it from : gtex ftp . shsu . edu / tex-archive / systems / msdos / gtex1 . 0 for ms windows / dos users . microemacs for windows is the host interface whose menus allow easy access to tex / metafont / amspell / bibtex / etc . also included are complete macro sets for plain tex , latex , nfss , e - tex , amslatex , and amstex . one person who responded to my query commented that gtex is less mature than emtex . i must say that he is probably right . installation took me much longer than i anticipated . here is a summary of the problems and their workarounds : 1 ) to begin with , the main tex . exe in the base directory does not accept arguments . i may have missed something , but i could not make latex work by the standard $ ) tex &lplain ( file-name > what i got was simply the tex environment . i could , of course , load lplain at this point and then load my file . but this is rather cumbersome . i found a workaround through micro-emacs , which is part of the package . 2 ) i did n't realize that if you unzip latex2e after unzipping latex , you clobber some of the latex 2 . 09 . sty files ( and you cannot use latex 2 . 09 as a result ) . there is a ( rather complex ) workaround and if you need latex2e only to begin with you are in good shape . however , it turned out that when you run latex2e . bat in the texfmts directory ( to generate the . fmt file for latex2e ) the name of the fmt file is latex . fmt , but it turned out that micro-emacs package expects a totally different fmt file for latex2e , namely a file called nfss2ltx . fmt . even changing the relevant bat file does not solve the problem . the only workaround i could find was to copy latex . fmt as nfss2ltx . fmt ( in short , if you do n't want the hassle , install latex only ) . 3 ) the dviwin package for both previewing and printing ( written by hipocrates sendoukas ) is rather nice . the feature that generates missing fonts automatically is particularly useful if your disk space is limited . however setting this option to work right was difficult and the documentation is not very helpful . if you run under windows nt ( as i do ) this is what you need to do : o select options / missing fonts . . . o select the third option ( append line to file and execute command ) o in the line text box write : call genpk $ f $ m $ x $ y $ x $ y $ d $ p $ e o in the file text box write : x : \ ( temp-dir ) \ < batch-file . bat > where x : is your hard drive , temp-dir is the value of your temp environment variable and batch-file is an arbitrary name for a batch file that will generatte missing fonts . for example , i use the following text : c : \ temp \ missing . bat o in the cmd text box write : genallnt . bat $ ( temp ) \ missing . bat where temp is the environment variable that contains the name of the directory in the file text box . note that in the cmd text box you need to use an environment variable ( you have to ) while in the file text box you cannot ( you must specify the literal name of the temp directory ) . it took me a while to figure this out and it was n't fun . if you do it wrong , dviwin takes control over your entire operating system , firing up and killing dos widows in rapid succession . you cannot even use nt 's task list to kill the runaway process .;Safe Email

995;summary :  grasshopper mind  short answer :  grasshopper mind  is british english , not japanese - english . summary answer : thanks to those linguist readers who responded to my query ( 5 . 1431 , 94 / 12 / 11 ) about  grasshopper mind ,  an expression that is entered into kenkyusha 's japanese - english and english - japanese dictionaries ( 1974 , 1980 ) and roget 's thesaurus ( 1982 ) , but apparently not found in any monolingual english dictionaries . the respondents , in alphabetical order , were : deborah milam berkley , marie egan , ted harding , steven schaufele , steve seegmiller , todd sieling , and stephen p . spackman . the inquiry asked four questions : ) do other english language reference works enter  the grasshopper mind  ? ) is it a varietal or dialectal term ? when was it first recorded ? are ) there analogous  grasshoppery  words in other languages ? ( 1 ) looking up  grasshopper mind  in english dictionaries is a lexicographical dead end . i ' ve checked dozens - - including old and new , standard and slang , uk and us , - - and not one enters it . some larger dictionaries record a derogatory sense of _ grasshopper _ , e . g . , the new shorter oxford english dictionary ( 1993 ) :  2 . _ fig . _ a person held to resemble a grasshopper in character or behaviour , an inconstant , flighty , or frivolous person . l16 .  and the near-synonym  grasshopper brain  is webster 's third new international dictionary ( 1971 ) usage example for _ grasshopper _ meaning 3 . 2  light and frivolous : untouched by care for the future .  ( 2 ) harding definitively answers the second question : )  grasshopper mind  is well-known standard uk english usage . to say ) someone  has a grasshopper mind  means that their focus of attention ) jumps unpredictably from subject to random subject . none of the other respondents , including three widely-dispersed speakers of american english ( berkley , egan , seegmiller ) , had seen or heard this collocation , but all agreed they could readily understand what it means . in terms of _ grasshopper _ meaning ' frivolous , careless , ' the semantics of  grasshopper mind  are fairly self-explanatory . ( 3 ) dating the  grasshopper mind  coinage is moot . harding says : ) i ' m sure it 's not particularly recent in origin . . . . i ' m pretty sure it ) must be possible to trace early uses of the phrase  grasshopper mind .  sieling suggests checking aesop 's  the ant and the grasshopper ,  and funk & wagnalls new standard dictionary ( 1913 ) defines _ grasshoppering _ as :  1 . an unsettled and unsteady course of life , improvident living : from the fable of the grasshopper and the ant .  ( 4 )  grasshopper mind  has cross-linguistic analogues . schaufele describes it as : ) like all those complex words in german that you can't find in ) any dictionary but which are crafted for the nonce by completely ) productive strategies and are perfectly understandable to any ) reasonably-intelligent speaker of the language ( i had to coin one ) of these myself the other day , ' lehrgangsprotokoll ' , to mean what ) we mean here by a 's chool transcript ' ) . spackman thinks  grasshopper mind  reads like a loan translation of a foreign expression , and mentions an interesting ojibwa calque : ) the phrase  fire stick  which has been given in novels and movies ) to ignorant american natives is apparently a literal , morpheme-by - ) morpheme translation of the ojibwa word for a gun . except for one ) thing : it 's not stupid .  fire  here translates  launch a projectile  ) and  stick  is the classifier for a rigid rod .  rigid projectile ) launcher  is not so snappy , but a rather tighter word than  gun  ) do n't you think ? the semantically transparent  grasshopper mind  reveals a lexicographical gap between english dictionaries published in the united states and the united kingdom . while unknown to most american anglophones and familiar to many uk anglophones , lexicographers have overlooked this metaphor for orthopterous mentality . modern lexicography is benefiting from computerized corpora and machine-readable dictionaries . for instance , searching for adjectival _ grasshopper _ + noun combinations in cobuilddirect 's on-line corpus ( direct @ cobuild . collins . co . uk ) reveals three occurrences of  grasshopper mind ,  two of  grasshopper warbler ,  and one each of  grasshopper leap ,   weather ,  and  nijinsky .  many dictionaries enter _ grasshopper warbler _ ( locustella naevia , characterized by its buzzing call ) but none _ grasshopper mind _ . further research is necessary . any information about this expression 's historical origins or distributional usages ( seegmiller asks about australian english ) would be gratefully welcomed . michael carr , otaru university of commerce , otaru 047 japan email carr @ canal . otaru-uc . ac . jp fax 81 + ( 0 ) 134-22 - 0467;Safe Email

1030;http://www.irishnews.com/access/daily/current.asp?SID=421083Loo rolls of honour and the invisible manPaper Clips: A round-up of the weekly pressBy Steven McCafferyThe powers-that-be tell us that crime does not pay. And they found an 
ally in the Ulster Herald this week, which carries a cautionary tale 
for anyone thinking of embarking on a criminal career. The 
Omagh-based paper's 'As the Man Says' column brings a story which 
originated in the Middle East.A gent recently attempted to rob a bank in Tehran, the columnist reports.He was unarmed and began seizing bank notes from customers' hands.It is then explained: He had paid Â£625 to a local sorcerer and 
believed that he was invisible.In the Lurgan Mail there was also news of a dramatic robbery.A Lurgan newsagent has told how thieves drilled their way through 
three walls to steal Â£10,000 worth of cigarettes recently in an 
attack which was well planned and professional, the paper reports.The thieves broke through the back wall of a religious gifts shop 
next door to the newsagents and then drilled through the partition 
between the back hallway and the front shop.Moving statues of religious icons out of the way, the gang then 
drilled into the back of the newsagent's cigarette stand removing the 
contents.The owner of the Paper Chase shop is pictured next to the gaping hole 
left in his store and is quoted as saying: On Monday morning when my 
wife was opening, everything looked normal.But when she opened the shutters she found herself looking into the 
shop next door.The paper reports that the shop was the target of another well 
organised crime 12 weeks ago when thieves escaped with a safe.The shop's owner says: The closer it gets to Christmas the more 
people are going to be open to this.The issues of crime and punishment are tackled by a columnist in the 
Down Democrat.Writing in the Downpatrick-based newspaper John Coulter calls on the 
authorities to birch the vandals plaguing the local community.He is shocked at reports of the wanton destruction by vandals and 
issues a call for action.The time has come to fight fire with fire, he writes, before 
unemployed paramilitaries decide to impose vigilante rule and start 
using so-called kangaroo courts to dish out their own brand of 
sentences on those found 'guilty' of anti-social behaviour.As an alternative to such reckless violence, he recommends, 
controlled violence.It was a sorry day that the Manx authorities banned the use of the 
birch as a weapon in dealing with unruly elements of the Isle of Man.Getting his defence in early, he immediately rounds on any woolly 
liberal who may oppose his plan.In many Islamic countries, public flogging of convicted criminals is 
the order of the day.You might laugh and say there is little chance of such measures 
being introduced in the United Kingdom or Ireland given that corporal 
punishment was abolished in the vast majority of northern schools in 
the late 1980s.However, people seem to forget that Islam is the fastest growing 
faith on the British mainland and it's only a matter of time before 
it numerically passes Christianity.

1072;> Bottom line: the late Senate Minority Leader certainly would have 
> endorsed the meaning behind the phrase, but it is questionable that he 
> ever coined it.An interesting link courtesy of the Harrow Report: there's no written 
evidence so far that Senator Everett Dirksen is the source of the 
infamous quote attributed to him. It's kind of astounding that there is 
enough general social consensus (25% of all queries makes it a *very* 
FAQ) and eyewitness reporting without a single written source. What 
the essay below doesn't seem to answer, though, is what the earliest 
attributed quote in print by any other writer is. I'd naturally be much 
more skeptical if the quote emerged after his death... RK===============================================================
http://www.dirksencenter.org/featuresBillionHere.htmA billion here, a billion there . . .Did Dirksen ever say,  A billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon 
you're talking real money? (or anything very close to that?)Perhaps not. Based on an exhaustive search of the paper and audio 
records of The Dirksen Congressional Center, staffers there have found 
no evidence that Dirksen ever uttered the phrase popularly attributed to 
him.Archivists undertook the search after studying research statistics 
showing that more than 25 percent of inquiries have to do with the quote 
or its variations.Here is what they examined: all of the existing audio tapes of the famed 
Ev and Charlie and Ev and Jerry shows, all newspapers clippings in 
the Dirksen Papers, about 12,500 pages of Dirksen's own speech notes, 
transcripts of his speeches and media appearances, transcripts of 
Republican leadership press conferences, and Dirksen's statements on the 
Senate floor as documented in the Congressional Record.Although Dirksen rarely prepared the text of a speech, preferring to 
rely on notes, he did employ brief phrases to remind him of a particular 
turn of phrase. For example, in referring to the public debt or 
excessive government spending, Dirksen would jot the word pothole to 
remind him to tell the following story, on this occasion in reference to 
the debt ceiling:
As I think of this bill, and the fact that the more progress we make 
the deeper we go into the hole, I am reminded of a group of men who were 
working on a street. They had dug quite a number of holes. When they got 
through, they failed to puddle or tamp the earth when it was returned to 
the hole, and they had a nice little mound, which was quite a traffic 
hazard.Not knowing what to do with it, they sat down on the curb and had a 
conference. After a while, one of the fellows snapped his fingers and 
said, â€˜I have it. I know how we will get rid of that overriding earth 
and remove the hazard. We will just dig the hole deeper.' 
[Congressional Record, June 16, 1965, p. 13884].
On the same occasion, Dirksen relied on yet another spending story, 
one he labeled cat in the well:
One time in the House of Representatives [a colleague] told me a story 
about a proposition that a teacher put to a boy. He said, â€˜Johnny, a cat 
fell in a well 100 feet deep. Suppose that cat climbed up 1 foot and 
then fell back 2 feet. How long would it take the cat to get out of the 
well?'Johnny worked assiduously with his slate and slate pencil for quite a 
while, and then when the teacher came down and said, â€˜How are you 
getting along?' Johnny said, â€˜Teacher, if you give me another slate and 
a couple of slate pencils, I am pretty sure that in the next 30 minutes 
I can land that cat in hell.'If some people get any cheer our of a $328 billion debt ceiling, I do 
not find much to cheer about concerning it. [Congressional Record, June 
16, 1965, p. 13884].
But there are no such reminders for the A billion here, a billion 
there . . .  tag line as there surely should have been given Dirksen's 
note-making tendencies. He spoke often and passionately about the debt 
ceiling, federal spending, and the growth of government. Yet there is no 
authoritative reference to the billion phrase.The chief evidence in support of Dirksen making the statement comes from 
people who claim to have heard him. The Library of Congress, for 
example, cites someone's personal observation on the campaign trail as 
evidence. The Dirksen Center has received calls from people who heard 
Dirksen say those words, some even providing the date of the event. But 
cross-checking that information with the records has, so far, turned up 
nothing in the way of confirmation.The closest documented statement came at a joint Senate-House Republican 
leadership press conference on March 8, 1962, when Dirksen said, The 
favorite sum of money is $1 billion â€“ a billion a year for a fatter 
federal payroll, a billion here, a billion there. [EMD Papers, 
Republican Congressional Leadership File, f. 25] But the and pretty 
soon you're talking real money is missing.In another close call, the New York Times, January 23, 1961, quoted 
Dirksen: Look at education â€“ two-and-one-half billion â€“ a billion for 
this, a billion for that, a billion for something else. Three to five 
billion for public works. You haven't got any budget balance left. 
You'll be deeply in the red. [Cited in Byron Hulsey's Everett Dirksen 
and the Modern Presidents, Ph.D. dissertation (May 1998, University of 
Texas, p. 226]Of course, the Dirksen Papers do not document completely the late 
Senator's comments. For example, The Center that bears his name does not 
have his testimony before committees. Their collection of Congressional 
Records ends in 1965, omitting the last four years of Dirksen's life and 
career â€“ he might have employed the phrase only late, although witnesses 
claim he said it throughout his career. Dirksen's campaign speeches 
tended not to produce transcripts, only sketchy notes or abbreviated 
newspaper accounts. Dirksen also held center stage before the video age, 
meaning that many remarks, particularly those in campaigns, escaped 
capture.Bottom line: the late Senate Minority Leader certainly would have 
endorsed the meaning behind the phrase, but it is questionable that he 
ever coined it.Â Â

next Monday? [ob: no-clue-how-they-remove-mayors-in-italy]Ouch. Ouch. Ouch.------------Get Sexier, Keep Husbands, Mayor Tells Wives
Wed Sep 4, 9:14 AM ETMISSAGLIA, Italy (Reuters) - Husband's eyes wandering? Make yourself sexier.
At least that's the solution proposed by an Italian mayor -- and a woman
mayor at that.Wives in the northern town of Missaglia had complained to mayor Marta
Casiraghi about a young woman who sunbathed topless on her terrace.They complained that the men in the town of some 7,000 people were spending
too much time ogling, so they asked Casiraghi to order the woman to put her
clothes back on.But the mayor, far from sympathizing, told the wives to get sexy if they
wanted to keep their men. The girl was very pretty and was soaking up some
sun. Topless sunbathing is largely tolerated and widespread nowadays.
There's nothing we can do, Casiraghi told Il Nuovo, a web-based newspaper.Instead, I'd advise the wives to play their rival at her own game -- make
themselves more beautiful.

for deep infrasound (pressure waves) with a network of stations designed 
to enforced the nuke test ban treaty we've discovered that pretty big 
impacts are the norm. Current infrasound stations can detect 
bolides/meteoroids in ~10 T TNT scale, but some 10 kT events are 
relatively frequent. A number of people died in the Tunguska event (1908, 
10-15 MT), despite it hitting in the middle of nowhere.http://216.239.39.100/search?q=cache:637JrhGDB5gC:www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/5thMars99/pdf/6081.pdf+bolide+impact+kT+wave&hl=en&ie=UTF-8In the Earth atmosphere a large number of bright light flashes of energies
in light impulse of about 0.1- 1 kt TNT and higher have been registered by
USA DoD satellites equipped with photoelectric detectors [9-11]. Intense
light impulses are created by impacts of meteoroids disrupted in the
atmosphere (mainly at altitudes of about 30-45 km). Several techniques for
the assessment of meteor- oid's characteristics from the light curves and
heights of peak intensities have been developed [3,12]. Using these
techniques the preatmospheric kinetic energy for Fifth International
Conference on Mars INITIATION OF SANDSTORMS: I.V.Nemtchinov, O.P.Popova,
V.A.Rybakov, V.V.Shuvalov a number of events was determined. The biggest
event is the 1 February 1994 with ini- tial energy as high as 30-40 kt TNT
(or initial mass of about 400 t). The bright flash with light energy of
about 4.5 kt TNT was caused by this meteoroid which deeply penetrated into
the atmosphere (at an angle of 45 degrees and velocity of 24 km/s) and
disintegrated above at altitudes of about 34 km and 21 km [9,12]. Another
famous impact event, the Sikhote-Alin meteor shower (12 February 1947
event), may be compared with the 1 February 1994 event. Initial masses of
these meteoroids are probably the same, as well as the angle of trajectory
inclination, but the initial velocity of the Sikhote-Alin is almost twice
smaller. That caused fragmentation of 1 February 1994 meteoroid at higher
altitudes and probably large fragments constitute a smaller part of the
pre- breakdown mass in contrast to the Sikhote-Alin event. In a rarefied
atmosphere of Mars analogous im- pactors will penetrate into deeper layers
of the atmos- phere.They will disintegrate lower 15 km or even reach the
planet surface, partially in disrupted form. Only the first disruption
would occur if a meteoroid similar to that caused the 1 February 1994 will
enter into the Martian atmosphere. And this body would reach the Mars
surface as a tense swarm of fragments. The meteoroid similar to that
caused the Sikhote-Alin event would hit the surface in a form of large
frag- ments due to its low velocity. They will create crater with the size
similar to that of the undisrupted meteoroid.

1084;addendum to coston 's object affixes in his summary of object affixes ( linguist list : vol-6 - 235 . fri 17 feb 1995 ) , simon corston observes : languages with object affixes but which lack affixes indicating other grammatical relations do occur , but would appear to be uncommon . that , however , really depends on what we mean by object affixes ( and subject affixes for that matter ) . so - called subject and object affixes fall into three types : ( i ) nonreferential / nonanaphoric agreement markers , ( ii ) ' functionally ambiguous ' agreement markers ( i . e . functioning as both nonreferential / nonanaphoric agreement markers and anaphoric / referential markers depending on the context ) ( bresnan and mchombo 1987 ) , and ( iii ) anaphoric or referential markers . the nuclear micronesian group provides an interesting case for the foregoing distinction . for instance , in woleaian , the subject markers are independent words , whereas the object markers are suffixes . but they are both functionally ambiguous agreement markers . in kusaiean , the subject and object markers are also independent words and suffixes , respectively . but they are all referential pronouns . for more detailed discussion of the nuclear micronesian languages see my paper : ' the verb - object bonding principle : with special reference to nuclear micronesian languages ' ( see refs below ) . if the complexity in subject and object affixes ( viz . the three types mentioned above ) is disregarded , probably corston 's observation may hold . but if only anaphoric / referential subject and object markers are taken into account , it may be a different story . in fact , in the same paper i have used a small convenience sample of 40 languages to ascertain whether the verb - object bonding principle ( as proposed in tomlin 1986 : ' a transitive verb and its object form a more cohesive , unified syntactic and semantic whole than do a transitive verb and its subject ' ) is evident in the pronominal system as well : e . g . object pronouns are more tightly bonded to the verb than subject pronouns are . the upshot of this investigation is that object pronouns ( e . g . affixes ) are more tightly bonded to the verb than subject pronouns ( e . g . independent words ) . this suggests that insofar as referential / anaphoric markers are concerned , ' languages with object affixes but which lack affixes indicating other grammatical relations ' may be crosslinguistically common , rather than uncommon . refereneces bresnan j . and s . mchombo 1987 . topic , pronoun , and agreement in chichewa . language 63 : 741-782 . givon , t . 1976 . topic , pronoun , and grammatical agreement . in subject and topic , ed . by c . n . li , pp . 149-188 . new york : academic press . tomlin , r . s . 1986 . basic word order : functional principles . london : croom helm . song , j . j . 1994 . the verb - object bonding principle : with special reference to nuclear micronesian languages . oceanic linguistics 33 . 2 ( in press ) . jae jung song university of otago new zealand;Safe Email
1085;-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----CERT Advisory CA-2002-21 Vulnerability in PHP   Original release date: July 22, 2002
   Last revised: --
   Source: CERT/CC   A complete revision history can be found at the end of this file.Systems Affected     * Systems running PHP versions 4.2.0 or 4.2.1Overview   A  vulnerability  has been discovered in PHP. This vulnerability could
   be  used  by  a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or crash PHP
   and/or the web server.I. Description   PHP  is  a  popular  scripting  language  in  widespread use. For more
   information about PHP, see          http://www.php.net/manual/en/faq.general.php   The  vulnerability  occurs  in the portion of PHP code responsible for
   handling  file uploads, specifically multipart/form-data. By sending a
   specially  crafted  POST  request  to  the web server, an attacker can
   corrupt  the  internal  data  structures used by PHP. Specifically, an
   intruder  can  cause  an improperly initialized memory structure to be
   freed.  In  most  cases, an intruder can use this flaw to crash PHP or
   the  web  server. Under some circumstances, an intruder may be able to
   take  advantage  of  this  flaw  to  execute  arbitrary  code with the
   privileges of the web server.   You  may  be  aware that freeing memory at inappropriate times in some
   implementations  of  malloc  and  free  does not usually result in the
   execution  of  arbitrary  code.  However, because PHP utilizes its own
   memory  management  system,  the  implementation of malloc and free is
   irrelevant to this problem.   Stefan  Esser  of  e-matters  GmbH has indicated that intruders cannot
   execute   code   on   x86   systems.   However,  we  encourage  system
   administrators  to  apply  patches  on  x86  systems  as well to guard
   against denial-of-service attacks and as-yet-unknown attack techniques
   that may permit the execution of code on x86 architectures.   This  vulnerability  was discovered by e-matters GmbH and is described
   in  detail  in  their  advisory.  The  PHP  Group  has  also issued an
   advisory.  A list of vendors contacted by the CERT/CC and their status
   regarding this vulnerability is available in VU#929115.   Although   this  vulnerability  only  affects  PHP  4.2.0  and  4.2.1,
   e-matters  GmbH  has  previously  identified  vulnerabilities in older
   versions  of  PHP.  If  you  are  running  older  versions  of PHP, we
   encourage you to review
   http://security.e-matters.de/advisories/012002.htmlII. Impact   A  remote  attacker can execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.
   An  attacker  may not be able to execute code on x86 architectures due
   to  the way the stack is structured. However, an attacker can leverage
   this  vulnerability  to  crash PHP and/or the web server running on an
   x86 architecture.III. SolutionApply a patch from your vendor   Appendix A contains information provided by vendors for this advisory.
   As  vendors report new information to the CERT/CC, we will update this
   section  and note the changes in our revision history. If a particular
   vendor  is  not  listed  below,  we  have not received their comments.
   Please contact your vendor directly.Upgrade to the latest version of PHP   If  a  patch  is  not  available  from your vendor, upgrade to version
   4.2.2.Deny POST requests   Until  patches  or an update can be applied, you may wish to deny POST
   requests.  The  following  workaround  is  taken from the PHP Security
   Advisory:     If  the  PHP  applications on an affected web server do not rely on
     HTTP POST input from user agents, it is often possible to deny POST
     requests on the web server.     In  the  Apache  web server, for example, this is possible with the
     following  code  included  in  the  main  configuration  file  or a
     top-level .htaccess file:     
        Order deny,allow
        Deny from all
          Note  that an existing configuration and/or .htaccess file may have
     parameters contradicting the example given above.Disable vulnerable service   Until  you  can upgrade or apply patches, you may wish to disable PHP.
   As a best practice, the CERT/CC recommends disabling all services that
   are not explicitly required. Before deciding to disable PHP, carefully
   consider your service requirements.Appendix A. - Vendor Information   This  appendix  contains  information  provided  by  vendors  for this
   advisory.  As  vendors  report new information to the CERT/CC, we will
   update this section and note the changes in our revision history. If a
   particular  vendor  is  not  listed  below, we have not received their

around France, so that no one can come into our precious country.  Again,
with a blink of the Genie's eye, 'POOF'  -  there was a huge wall around
France.  The Englishman asks, I'm very curious. Please tell me more about

1090;organizational changes we are making a number of significant organizational changes . these changes are intended to accomplish four key objectives : first , we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successful business model developed over the last decade in north america and europe . this model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built around a relatively small strategic asset position . second , we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting relationships . particularly with joe sutton  , s departure , the ability to directly manage the day - to - day activities of 15 independent business units has become increasingly difficult . third , we need to accomplish these changes without , in any way , compromising the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower - yielding asset positions . and fourth , as always , we need to take advantage of the reorganization to redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities . enron wholesale services today , we are forming enron wholesale services ( ews ) which will consolidate our global wholesale businesses . the closer alignment of our wholesale businesses will accomplish the following : ( 1 ) enhanced communication and coordination across business units , ( 2 ) more rapid deployment of people to higher valued opportunities , ( 3 ) more effective prioritization of opportunities across the wholesale business , and ( 4 ) more rapid extension of enron  , s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries and markets . enron wholesale services will include our current north american , european ( including japan and australia ) , global markets , and industrial markets operations , and will be expanded to include enron  , s net works business unit as well as a new unit  ) enron global assets . in addition , enron  , s merchant businesses outside of north america and europe will be integrated into this new structure as described below . mark frevert , currently chairman of each of our wholesale units , will assume the role of chairman and ceo of enron wholesale services . greg whalley , currently chairman and ceo of enron net works , will join mark in the office of the chairman as president and chief operating officer . providing further impetus for these organizational changes , several of our international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadership positions : rebecca mcdonald , currently ceo of enron apachi , will join ews as president and ceo of enron global assets . enron global assets will have responsibility for managing all of enron  , s existing energy asset portfolio outside of north america and europe . joining rebecca in the office of the chairman as coo will be jim hughes , currently coo of enron apachi . rebecca and jim will report to the ews office of the chairman . sanjay bhatnagar , currently ceo of enron india , has joined ebs as ceo for the middle east and asia region . sanjay will be responsible for building our broadband business in this region and the current ebs team in this region will report to sanjay . in this role , sanjay will report to the ebs office of the chairman . in addition , sanjay will continue to remain responsible for enron  , s wholesale energy business in india and will transition this business into enron global assets in the near future . diomedes christodoulou , currently co - ceo of enron south america , has joined ebs as chief commercial officer . diomedes will be located in london and will focus his origination activities on global opportunities , with near term attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors . diomedes will report to the ebs office of the chairman . jim bannantine , currently co - ceo of enron south america , will be joining ees to lead ees  , commercial efforts outside north america and europe . in order to ensure a smooth transition for our south american businesses and to facilitate our asset sales activities , jim will remain in south america for at least the next several months and continue to serve as ceo of enron south america . throughout the transition , jim will report to cliff baxter and to the office of the chairman of enron wholesale services . following the transition , jim will join ees . in addition to these changes in our international asset operations activities , we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale businesses and the commercial support functions : enron net works louise kitchen will assume greg  , s previous responsibilities as president and ceo of enron net works , reporting into mark and greg . enron americas concurrent with the transfer to enron global assets of responsibility for operating enron  , s south and central america asset base , all trading , marketing , and new asset development activities in these regions will report into a new entity , enron americas . enron americas will have responsibility for all wholesale merchant businesses across north , central and south america . dave delainey , president and ceo , and john lavorato , chief operating officer will comprise the office of the chairman for enron americas . enron europe the enron europe organization , which includes enron  , s businesses in australia and japan , and enron metals , remains unchanged under the leadership of john sherriff , president and ceo , and michael brown , chief operating officer . enron global markets enron global markets , under the leadership of mike mcconnell , president and ceo , and jeff shankman , chief operating officer , will continue to have responsibility for enron  , s middle east and lng operations . with the exception of ecoelectrica in puerto rico , all operating power plants and associated personnel in the caribbean and central america will transfer to enron global assets . enron global markets will also continue to manage the commodity businesses in crude and products , coal , weather , insurance , equities , interest rates , foreign exchange , and agricultural products . enron industrial markets enron industrial markets  , organization , under the leadership of jeff mcmahon , president & ceo , and ray bowen , chief operating officer , remains unchanged . commercial support for ews the commercial support functions for ews will remain with , and be managed by , the individual business units . we are creating no incremental overhead in the creation of ews , and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more efficient utilization and sharing of resources across ews . to this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across ews in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units . these newly defined roles are as follows : mid and back office operations  ) sally beck will lead mid and back office operations across ews . these services will become part of enron net works , with sally reporting to louise kitchen and rick causey , executive vice president and chief accounting officer . this alignment creates a coordinated services organization with it and e -

1091;I saw your email on a website I visited yesterday, and thought
you might be interested in this. A few months back I joined a program and then...promptly forgot
about it. You may have done this yourself sometime...you intend
to work the program but then get caught in your day-to-day
activities and it's soon forgotten.The program was free to join so maybe I just didn't take it very
seriously.Anyway, near the end of May I received a letter from my
sponsor (Vic Patalano) informing me that I had more than 2000
PAID members in my downline!As you can imagine, I was very skeptical. After all, how could I
have more than 2000 paid members under me in a program that I had
never promoted?I took the time to check out the site...then wrote to Vic asking
for confirmation that these were paid members and not just free
sign-ups...like me :)Well, it was true...I had 2365 paid members in my downline. This
in a program that I had never worked!All I had to do was upgrade to a paid membership before the end
of the month and I would have my position locked in and a
downline of 2365 people.You can bet I wasted no time in getting my membership upgraded!I can tell you, if I had known what was happening with this
program, I would have become an active paid member months ago!With this program, you will get a HUGE downline of PAID MEMBERS.

openssl. What version of openssh do you have? Is it an official Red Hat
package? I suppose it isn't, and using Red Hat's rpms will solve your
problem.What you need to know for openssl is :
0.9.5b is libcrypto.so.0 and libssl.so.0
0.9.6  is libcrypto.so.1 and libssl.so.1
0.9.6b is libcrypto.so.2 and libssl.so.2Now in all Red Hat packages I've seen so far, the only dependency is on
those files and not on openssl = version.Matthias--

1112;Hi,Four of the IE nameservers are publishing out of date DNS information.
The four listed below are publishing the IE zone from last Friday.
They are six days behind reality. 192.16.202.11    NS.EU.NET.
 192.93.0.4       NS2.NIC.FR.
 198.133.199.102  GNS1.DOMAINREGISTRY.IE.
 198.133.199.103  GNS2.DOMAINREGISTRY.IE.The upshot of this is that correct DNS resolution for IE DNS data that
has been added or updated since last Friday is going to be 
intermittant. If you're lucky your resolver will query one of the five
nameservers that are publishing an up-to-date zone. Unfortunately, five
out of nine aren't good odds.Don't forget, if you lose the gamble your resolver is going to cache
the bad data for up to two days.If you're a user of BIND 8 or BIND 9 you could add	blackhole {
		192.16.202.11,
		192.93.0.4,
		198.133.199.102,
		198.133.199.103,
	},to your named.conf and restart BIND to avoid query the bad nameservers.
This will prevent _any_ queries to those servers.Putting	16.1.0.18
	204.123.2.18
	16.1.0.19
	192.111.39.100
	212.17.32.2
	193.1.142.2in /service/dnscache/root/servers/ie and restarting dnscache will
have the same result for dnscache users.
ATB,
james

1129;southwest power financing louise , i spoke to chip and he mentioned your concern / question about the financing of this project . to be clear , the turbines and some of the equipment are in turbopark . however , global finance does not want to construct this project inside of turbopark because accounting believes that would be problematic for our fair market value treatment of our merchant investments . global finance ' s plan is to provide a jedi ii / ena bridge loan to the project for the non - turbine construction costs through a bridge loan from may 1 through sep 30 . the expected loan amount during this time period is $ 30 mm , split between ena and jedi ii . our economics assume the bridge loan is priced at 15 % . global finance has committed to arrange non - recourse project financing so that ena / jedi will have only a $ 40 mm combined investment once the financing closes by sep 30 . also during this time period we will be actively marketing the project with the intent to divest of it fully prior to sep 30 . hopefully that clarifies things . regards , chris;Safe Email

1134;workshop annoncement and call for papers - clitics workshop announcement and call for papers c l i t i c s 24th - 26th february 1999 konstanz university , germany we are pleased to announce our workshop on ' clitics ' during the 21st annual meeting of the german society of linguistics in konstanz ( germany ) . in linguistic research , clitics play an increasingly prominent role . the status of clitics is under discussion in phonology , morphology , and syntax , as well as in the respective interfaces . in these fields , the discussion on clitics gives rise to controversial analyses . one open question is whether we need in fact a separate linguistic category ' clitic ' , or whether these elements can be subsumed under different linguistic categories , such as affixes . - with respect to phonology , it is undetermined how clitics are incorporated into phonological structure . should we distinguish a clitic group in the prosodic hierarchy , are clitics part of prosodic words , or are they left outside prosodic structure ? how is their phonological deficiency best accounted for ? - concerning the morphology of clitics , especially regarding the occurrence of opaque clitics in clitic clusters , analyses within the framework of distributed morphology compete with those which propose an optimality theoretic solution . - also , the morphosyntactic status of clitics is unclear . is it possible to capture the order of clitics in clitic clusters in a more explanatory way than in terms of templates ? the complex conditions on clitic doubling give rise to the question whether clitics should be analysed as agreement markers or as arguments . - syntactic aspects of clitics play a major role in recent analyses in different theoretical frameworks . for instance , there is no agreement on the explanation of clitic climbing and it is an unsettled issue whether clitic placement should be accounted for in a syntactic , prosodic , prosodic-syntactic , or optimality-theoretic approach . the workshop intends to bring together phonologists , morphologists , and syntacticians and provides an ideal opportunity to share insights and to discuss the issues mentioned above . in addition to the invited speaker presentations , there are 9 slots for 30 - minute presentations , and 3 slots for 1 hour presentations ( including discussion ) . invited speakers : geert booij ( free university amsterdam ) jane grimshaw ( rutgers university ) juan uriagereka ( university of maryland ) please send a one-page abstract before 15th august 1998 to : birgit gerlach & janet grijzenhout , seminar fuer allgemeine sprachwissenschaft , heinrich - heine - universitaet , universitaetsstr . 1 , 40225 duesseldorf , germany . we may be contacted by e-mail at gerlach @ phil-fak . uni-duesseldorf . de , or grijzenh @ phil-fak . uni-duesseldorf . de;Safe Email

kids are put in front of the television for hours each day, to be 
influenced by what the media and government thinks is important.  I 
learned a long time ago that what they think is important and what is are 
two different things.  I threw the TV out when Xi was 9.  She's got her 
own place now, and still doesn't have one.  YaY!  Another thing that's 
wrong is what goes on in public schools.  Some allow a bit of 
individuality, but only for a class or a short period of time, depending 
on the teachers, most of the time.  I dunno how many times I've seen Xi 
come home from school absolutely miserable or outraged about something 
that happened at school.  She made it to college, though, whew.  It's a 
big problem to tackle, and I don't know the answer.  I like the idea of 
the voucher system, because in a way it is a way parents can vote more 
efficiently for how their kids are taught.

( vnbl . ob ) is a holding company , which is identifying and acquiring operational business opportunities in the areas of homeland security , security information systems , and other security services to provide long term growth for its shareholders . vinoble believes that the opportunity to build a successful business in the security sector is unprecedented . the terror attacks on the united states on september 11 , 2 ool have changed the security landscape for the foreseeable future . both physical and logical security have become paramount for all industry segments , especially in the banking , healthcare and government sectors . while the focus for vinoble is on north america , the opportunity for security services is worldwide . according to giga , a wholly owned subsidiary of forrester research , worldwide demand for information security products and services is set to eclipse $ 46 b by 2005 . vinoble intends to capitalize on the dramatic growth in the security market by delivering professional services , security products , security training , and managed security services . in pursuit of this objective , vinoble has assembled a highly qualified team of security professionals offering a full range of security services . through vinoble ' s consulting services and integrated delivery solutions , vinoble will help organizations protect key assets including persons , property , information , brand , and reputation . homeland security , the national strategy for a secure cyberspace , the healthcare insurance portability and accountability act ( hipaa ) , sarbanes - oxley and other regulatory programs will all cause a continued increase in security demands in the united states and abroad . vinoble intends to position itself as the ' most desired ' provider of , both , physical and information security solutions - in the eyes of our clients , alliance partners , and peers . we will accomplish this by ensuring our teams are the most knowledgeable , agile , professional , and cost - conscious provider of ' tailored ' security solutions to meet the unique needs of each client . management has partnered with garcyco capital corp . ( gccc ) to assist in finding acquisition candidates for the company , structuring such acquisitions , and effecting a transition to corporate growth . at present , vinoble and gccc have targeted several companies as potential acquisition candidates . pending the outcome of due diligence and audits , the company believes the acquisition of these assets will provide the basis required for listing on a national exchange . here is recent news on the company : malibu , calif . - - ( business wire ) - - may 20 , 2 oo 5 - - vinoble , inc . ( otcbb : vnbl - news ) , a holding company seeking to identify long - term growth opportunities in the areas of homeland security , security information systems , and other security services , is pleased to announce that as it continues in its efforts to reach definitive agreements on the acquisition of assets , businesses , and strategic partners in the rfid and gps tracking sector , vinoble has further engaged with several additional businesses and individuals for the purpose of acquiring technology , software , and patents . following the move to acquire rfid ( radio frequency identification ) technology , hardware and patents for the sole purpose of specific use applications , the company has concluded that the need for application support software or middleware is part of the fundamental component of the framework which operates such technology . the company has identified several sources for both licensing and the acquisition of such software , and has begun to pursue discussions to access this important element . middleware is used primarily to link disparate applications , both internally and externally , to the enterprise . this typically involves routing data using different transport protocols , translating data into different formats and providing a suitable means of integration such as web services and service - oriented architectures . since rfid is an integral part in the tracking of both mobile and non - mobile assets , user - friendly and efficient management software enabling customers to manage rfid data both incoming and out - bound is important in maintaining customer loyalty and reduces costs associated with customer service . management software will allow for real time visibility of assets or product inventory , whether in transit , in a warehouse , at the manufacturing plant , or on a store shelf . visibility and accuracy will enable customers to reduce handling costs , gain instant access to shipment information and increase inventory flow throughout the supply chain . the ability to manage data collection from a number of different rfid and gps devices is essential for proper efficiency of the system . the company believes that such acquisition of middleware technology will be essential and will further position vinoble in the vastly growing rfid and gps tracking industry . the company ' s goal is to provide critical security services at a cost manageable to even the smallest of businesses that can ' t afford to do without the safety of their personnel and assets in this current state of constant threat . safe harbor statement : this press release contains forward - looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 ( the act ) . in particular , when used in the preceding discussion , the words plan , confident that , believe , scheduled , expect , or intend to , and similar conditional expressions are intended to identify forward - looking statements within the meaning of the act and are subject to the safe harbor created by the act . such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties , and actual results may differ materially from those expressed in any forward - looking statement . such risks and uncertainties include , but are not limited to , the ability of vinoble to complete the proposed acquisition ( s ) , the results of vinoble ' s due diligence review of the candidate ( s ) , the success of the business of the acquisition candidate ( s ) , including the ability of vinoble to continue to sell the applicable products and the acceptance of those newly designed products by the market , market conditions , the general acceptance of the company ' s products and technologies , competitive factors , timing , and other risks described in the company ' s sec reports and filings . the closing of the transaction will be subject to complete due diligence , inspections , and completion of audited financial statements in accordance to gaap as required by the sec prior to consummation . we believe the speculative near term target price is - $ o . 50 we believe the speculative long term target price - $ 4 . 00 we feel this is our best pick since december of 2 oo 4 !

2) change to another folder

1175;200 summary on reduplication a month before christmas ( in linguist vol-5 - 1354 ) i sent out a query about * reduplication * and how this strategy is grammaticalized in languages to convey some facet of * intensification * . this is a summary based on the 45 replies i received from linguist netters . allow me to thank you all collectively now , since i will not be referring to single respondents in the following discussion . the topic of reduplication interests me because i am writing on my phd on repetition with respect to intensification and iconicity in swedish . the point of departure in the original query were the claims found in lakoff & johnson ( metaphors we live by , 1980 ) according to which reduplication may indicate : - plural or collective - intensification or increase - continuation or completion - diminution thus , ' more ' of physical linguistic ' form ' corresponds to ' more ' in the ' content ' of the reduplicated expression as opposed to a non-reduplicated form - - as an instance of diagrammatic iconicity ( or as a realization of the * conduit * metaphor in the terms of lakoff & johnson ) . there are reflections of the outlined principles in colloquial english in expressions like ' an old old man ' , ' the music got louder and louder ' , 's he talks talks talks ' , ' the ball bounced and bounced ' , ' there 's forms forms forms forms ' , ' it was sinking down down ' , etc . i originally mentioned , however , that these structures were * marked * in a language like english . the choice of words was perhaps not so lucky . what i meant by  marked  is that even if we may think that such expressions are frequent in casual speech , they are rare in more constrained contexts . a less marked way of intensifying would probably be to use a specific intensifier or quantifier , e . g . ' a very old man ' , ' talks a lot ' . i hope no one will be offended by this simplistic analysis , it is only leading us a bit beside the point . ( for a comprehensive account on  repetition in english  , see persson 1974 , univ . of uppsala , sw . ) i was in my query more after pointers to and examples of languages where reduplication as a means of * intensification * is an integrated , so to speak , a standard characteristic of the grammar . this was also , more or less , what i got . i will summarize the outcome in the following , i am aware of that in most instances the  facts  are probably subject to qualification , but for the sake of clarity & brevity i will lay the examples ahead in a rather list-like manner . furthermore , the examples certainly represent only a sample of the languages in the world that have incorporated reduplication in their system . note that i have left out - - in order to make it all more illustrative - - possible tone marks and diacritics of the transliteration . 1 . plural or collective * in malay / bahasa ( indonesia ) , full word reduplication turns singular to plural : anak ' child ' anak-anak ' children ' * in nahuatl ( or  aztec  ) , prefixed reduplication with nouns conveys a plural meaning : cih-tli ' hare ' ( where ' cih - ' is the stem ) ci : cih-tli pl . - - moreover , there are no structurally distinct adjectives in nahuatl but certain  adjectival  suffixes that can take on a plural notion via reduplication : - pi : l diminutive suffix - pipi : l plural * hausa is cited to have reduplication in the formation of plurals of a limited set of nouns . * in japanese , reduplication may turn a noun to a collective , but the scope of this strategy is said to be marginal : hito ' person ' hitobito ' people ' kami ' god ' kamigami ' gods ' * in mandarin ( chinese ) , reduplication turns singular to collective ( but this is said to be rare ) : ren ' person ' renren ' people ' - - moreover , both in mandarin and cantonese * classifier * items may be reduplicated to convey  universal quantification  in contrast to more unique reference . this fits readily in the notion of intensification ( or augmentation ) : ge ren ' a person ' ( mandarin ) ge ge ren ' every person ' douh ' place , there ' ( cantonese ) douh-douh ' everywhere ' * dakotan patterns plurals of stative intransitive verbs with reduplication . this is said only to apply to instances with inanimate subjects though . north american languages in general may be of interest when considering reduplication but i am short of examples at present . following languages were mentioned in the replies , though : klamath , nez perce , sahaptin . 2 . intensification or increase * mandarin chinese intensifies adjectives with reduplication : xiao 's mall ' xiaoxiao ' very small ' gaoxing ' happy ' gaogaoxingxing ' very happy ' as you notice , with disyllabic adjectives the reduplication pattern is aabb . - - cantonese also uses reduplication for augmentation or emphasis . * turkish is , apparently , a point in case . reduplication of adjectives indicates intensification or increase in the following way : temiz ' clean ' tertemiz ' very clean ' dolu ' full ' dopdolu ' very full ' bos ' empty ' bosbos ' completely empty ' here we have prefixed reduplication accompanied with a binding consonant . interestingly , there do not seem to be  rules  for which binding consonant should be inserted in a given case . * hausa is cited to use reduplication in the intensification of adjectives . * celtic languages have full word reduplication to indicate intensification . the method is reminiscent of the case of english , but it may be more  integrated  in the grammar of the celtic ( are there any opinions about this ? ) . could the celtic model have influenced germanic languages so that we still today have rather similar reduplication in the colloquial registers ( just my own modest idea . . . ) ? here are some examples provided by netters : - - welsh : ty bach bach ' a very small house ' oglau cryf cryf ' a very strong smell ' - - gaelic : fada fada ' very long ' trua trua ' very pity ' - - breton : braz-braz ' very tall ' this is said to be common especially in negative sentences . * in colloquial russian reduplication / repetition of adj 's / adv 's has likewise an intensifying function . the use is probably stylistically similar to repetition in colloquial english , but it is said to be limited to * predicate * adjectives : belyj-belyj ' very white ' tixo-tixo ' very quietly ' * it was also pointed that finnish has prefixed reduplication in some intensified adjectival forms . this is true , indeed , but - - what it seems - - wholly lexicalized and non-productive . in any case , here are some examples i and my colleague enjoyed coming up with : taysi ' full ' ( umlaut a ) tapo-taysi ' completely full ' ( uml . a 's & o ) tyhja ' empty ' ( uml . a ) typo-tyhja ' compl . empty ' ( uml . a 's & o ) puhdas ' clean ' puti-puhdas ' compl . clean ' uusi ' new ' upo-uusi ' brand new ' pinta 's urface ' piri-pinta ' right on the surface ' suomalainen ' finnish ' supi-suomalainen ' purely finnish ' yksin ' alone ' ypo-yksin ' compl . alone ' ( uml . o ) tiessaan ' lost ' ( uml . a 's ) tipo-tiessaan ' compl . lost ' ( uml . a 's & o ) the prefixed items ' tapo ' , ' typo ' , ' tipo ' , 's upi ' , ' puti ' , ' piri ' , ' upo ' , ' ypo ' do not seem to mean anything , at least for the speakers today . it seems that the first vowel or the pair first consonant & vowel of the stem are reduplicated with a binding syllable that most often has a ' p ' and a vowel , e . g . : ta-po - taysi , ty-po - tyhja , u-po - uusi , y-po - yksin could this have been productive in some earlier stage of the language ? * finally , in classical ( only ? ) greek a small number of * verbs * may have reduplication to communicate some sort of intensifying , expressive or affective notions : pam-phain - ei ' it shines brightly ' ( ( * phan-phan - j-ei ) 3 . continuation or completion reduplication is , evidently , often used in the formation of present , progressive or perfective . i take here the view that present or progressive forms combine with * continuation * , whereas perfective forms communicate * completion * . it was nice to discover that  classical  linguistic tradition can offer fitting data here . it feels appropriate to begin with these examples . - - - * in sanskrit , the perfect stem is formed by reduplication : budh - ' know ' bubodh - perf . jan - ' born ' jajan - perf . aorist ( ' true perfect ' ) roots may also be formed by a kind of reduplication : jan - ajijana - ( aor . ) in addition , present stems may be formed by reduplication : bhii - 'd rink ' bibhii - pres . * classical greek uses partial reduplication , i . e . prefixation of the initial consonant of a verb plus the vowel ' e ' , in stems for perfect tenses : le-lu - k-a ' i have freed ' pe-poie : - k-a ' i have made ' ge-grap - tai ' it has been written ' if the root begins with a vowel , the vowel is augmented . furthermore , some common verbs take reduplication in their * present * tense , the initial consonant is reduplicated with the vowel ' i ' : di-do : - mi ' i give / am giving ' gi-gno - mai ' i am becoming ' ti-the : - mi ' i am placing ' ( ( * thi-the : - mi ) * in latin , perfect forms may involve reduplication : curro ' run ' cucurri perf . - - - let us then go over to more living languages . * in hausa , reduplication applied to verbs in two different ways expresses completion or continuity respectively . modified suffixed reduplication gives an idea of * completed * action : cika ' fill ' cikakke compl . jefa ' throw ' jefaffe compl . prefixed reduplication communicates  something like continuity  , as expressed by the respondent : buga ' beat ' bubbuga ' keep on beating ' kira ' call ' kikkira ' call various people ' * in tagalog ( philippines ) , reduplication distinguishes * imperfective * actions from perfective : bili root of ' buy ' bibili irrealis imperfective upo root of 's it ' uupo irr . imp . kuha root of ' get ' kukuha irr . imp . some scholars call irrealis perfective * completed * aspect and irrealis imperfective * contemplated * aspect . this makes sense , since irrealis imperfective ' bibili ' seems to translate to ' will buy ' . * in wailevu / fijian ( austronesia ) , reduplication is used in so called  object defocusing  that involves repetition of the action and a progressive marker : au xau-ta na agone ' i carry the child ' au xau-xau jixo ' i ' m carrying now ' au dola-va na xaatuba ' i open the window ' au dola-dola jixo ' i ' m opening now ' moreover , in this language adjectives may be derived from verbs through reduplication . even if noted to be  not productive  , the process is fascinating : sava-ta ' wash - tr ' sava-sava - a ' clean ' the adjective could be understood to represent * completed * action , the result , in a way very similar to how the perfect participle works in , say , germanic : she has washed the cloth . - - ) a washed cloth * in nahuatl (  aztec  ) , reduplication may affect the meaning of a verb in several ways . - - an action carried out in a  systematic  ( progressive ? ) way : tequi base for ' to slice ' or ' to hack ' te : tequi 's lice / carve something ' cho : ca ' weep ' cho : cho : ca ' weep continuously ' - - of the same base verbs , an action carried out in a  random  ( involving repetition ? ) way : tehtequi ' hack something up ' chohcho : ca ' to sob ' - - furthermore , reduplication may be recursive ( e . g . of ' weep continuously ' & 's ob ' respectively ) : cho : cho : cho : ca chohchohcho : ca - - verbs with certain morphologic characteristic may take on reduplication to indicate * repeated action * : tzili : ni ' make a metallic sound ' tzttzilica ' jingle ' tzitzilitza ' make something jingle ' * in afrikaans , reduplication applied to some verbs seems give a progressive idea : hy loop eet-eet ' he eats continuously while walking ' 4 . diminution there are not many examples of * diminution * in the total of replies . in a sense , the process of  making something smaller  could possibly go under the more general strategy of * intensification or increase * ( although it is literally about  decrease  ) . nevertheless , there were a couple of possibly fitting cases : * cantonese may use reduplication to convey * diminution * or * moderation * . * it was pointed that english ( ! ) has some  diminutive  reduplication in formations like ' itsy-bitsy ' , ' eensie - weensie ' , ' teeny-tiny ' . these carry the content ' very small ' , but they belong merely to the child-speak register . in any case , the examples are diagnostic of the diminutive case . 5 . other there are uses of reduplication that go beyond the suggested four categories above . with some restraint , some of these could perhaps be seen as slight offsprings of the more general principle of marking * plurality * . i do not go into detailed examples but mention some most common semantic categories : - - distributive reduplication : presupposes two or more referents that are taken separately ( type : ' one by one ' ) - - reflexive notions go naturally hand in hand with distributive ( type : ' one another ' ) - - the so called * delimitative aspect * , i . e . 'd oing something for a while ' , in mandarin and cantonese does not at first seem to fit in * continuity * or * completion * . however , the semantics of the delimitative aspect is said to encompass  implied repetition  : tai-tai ' take a look at ' ( cant . ) chang-chang ' have a taste ' ( man . ) shi-shi ' have a go ' ( man . ) what would seem logical to me is that a casual , temporally short action like ' take a look ' reaches its termination quicker than standard ' looking ' . i do n't know if this kind of an implicit sense of  rapid completion  could be the motivation of this reduplication ? - - - then there are numerous instances of reduplication that communicate * contrastive emphasis * . these do not necessarily combine with the above functional categories at all . the motivation of such reduplication is merely to * make a point * clearer . the ( american ) english  double  is a seemingly nice example of this : shall we rent a car car , or would you rather have a jeep ? of course , emphasis is a sort of * intensification * and , thus , it touches the theme of our discussion . * * * * now i think it 's time to close this rather lengthy summary . thanks for reading it . if you would like to add something to the discussion - - like comment on my suggestions - - , feel free to e-mail ( or snailmail ) the  stuff  directly to me .

( i think ferc staff should be involved or it will get bogged down ) . parties should reconvene within 15 days after ferc ' s order adopting a model and the ferc order should direct the participants ( like us ) to submit a joint proposal within 45 days thereafter . she recommends to ferc that parties be allowed to file comments to ferc within 20 days ( however , she recommends against permitting reply comments since they may prove counterproductive to the collaborative nature of the mediation process . ) the commission will then issue an order that can adopt her recommendations , may reject her recommendations , or change something . i would expect that the commission would adopt many of her recommendations , while allowing further mediated - type discussions on some issues ( hopefully , ferc will adopt many of our suggested changes ) . judge mccartney then basically describes both proposals of the grid group and the southern , etal . group , then provides the stakeholder participants ' comments ( almost verbatim from all submissions to her ) . while she states that the process should keep moving quickly , she does not adopt any timeframes ( we will comment that ferc should retain its dec 02 day 2 start date ( for lmp / financial rights congestion model to be implemented ) . the attachments below are her report , the southern , etal proposal and the grid pricing , congestion management , operating , and planning protocols ( without any changes ) . clearly , our response ferc will include our proposed changes to the documents . highlights from her report below : she recommends that spp pursue an rto coalition in the midwest she encourages ferc to continue to encourage and utilize a collaborative process which accommodates stakeholders and state utility commission input , regardless of the rto platform ultimately adopted by ferc her opinion is that the  grid ( entergy , gridsouth and gridflorida utility sponsored ) model  ( transco in rto , lmp / financial rights congestion management ) is better developed and more clearly in compliance with the requirements of order no . 2000 based on a  best practices  analysis of other rtos and commission precedent . this is good because enron generally favors the grid model . however , she does provide the commission information on southern , etal . ' s proposal ( independent system administrator - - like national grid - type ) in her report , even though she has concerns that the southern , etal model is not order no . 2000 compliant . the southern , etal . model has a hybrid physical congestion management with day ahead balanced schedule requirements and lmp in real time ( with penalties ) and significant control area responsibilities . the significant aspects of the grid model are discussed below : grid governance : rto is a for profit transco with an independent board and an enhancement : the independent market administrator ( ima ) . the ima was added to facilitate public power participation ( worried that transmission owner on top , even if divested from generation , would favor its transmission solutions over generation or other transmission solution ) . the ima would administer the markets , exercise operational authority over the transmission system , administer one oasis ( with one process for interconnection and transmission requests ) , and assume the security coordinator function . she strongly encourages this split . good stakeholder advisory committee ( provides majority and minority views ) and an independent market monitor to monitor the rto and the markets allows for independent transmission companies ( entergy wants to be one ) , with rto oversight describes that control area operators will initially maintain their control areas for physical operation , such as switching transmission elements , pursuant to operating procedures approved by the rto / ima . recognizes that consolidation of control areas may occur as rto matures . ( protocols should be subject to further discussion ) rto / transco has primary responsibility for tariff administration , including rate changes and tariff filings all load under the rates , terms and conditions of oatt ( gridsouth group has appealed this part of earlier commission orders , and , thus , retains their rights should they win on appeal ) 4 transmission pricing zones initially : entergy , southern , gridsouth , and gridflorida . allows for participant funded , direct assigned , and merchant transmission . transmission rates to loads in rto will be zonal ( for existing facilities ) and regional charge ( for new facilities , other than those above ) . there will be one  through and out rate  , plus a grid management charge for rto operation . encourages conversion of existing transmission agreements to oatt financial rights / lmp ( includes  real time spot market  ) is clearly the preferred model and represents best practices model ( from pjm and spp ) - - many details need to be worked out in continued discussions . model allows parties to transact bilaterally and provides financial congestion hedges ( fch ) . stakeholder process needs to be continued for fch allocation , auction and non - discriminatory release . the grid model includes a  balancing resource  requirement that we will provide comments against will allow establishment of markets for ancillary services once they can be supported - - control area operators required to provide before such market establishment rto runs single oasis and independently calculates atc and ttc rto / transco is responsible for planning through a participatory stakeholder process numerous comments from marketers , ipps on reduction of control area functions ( all of our comments from last week ' s response are included ) judge mccartney had numerous meetings with state commissioners . ( 1 ) many are still concerned that ferc had not conducted a  cost - benefit  analysis and had concerns over the costs . she responds that extrapolation of costs to the entire se rto seems unwarranted because it ignores the  economies of scale  and initial reliance on existing control centers and infrastructure . in any event , ferc could explore the feasibility of a rate setting process that would involve the state commissions . ( 2 ) concerned about cost shifting : mediation team discussed phase in of rates that the commission has allowed .

1189;re : pricing credit on thousands of names we can continue the discussion in tuesday ' s conference call , but i discussed with ben about the issues below , and here are some thoughts . this is not a complete approach , but only a starting point for discussion . the main task is to build a pricing system for many names . this has two components - - - 1 ) how to price a single name ? 1 . 1 ) how to price a liquid single name ? 1 . 2 ) how to price an illiquid single name ? 2 ) how to efficiently apply the methodology to multiple names ? the approach i would take for 1 . 1 is a ) define a small set of liquid names b ) apply each of the different models we have , say , the six models ben has mentioned below , to these names c ) include market prices , if any , for these names d ) sit with traders , get trader ' s intuition on where each liquid name should price and note this on the spectrum of prices obtained in ( b ) and ( c ) e ) try to determine attributes of the names that may explain the dispersion of the trader prices across the models f ) quantify these attributes , if possible g ) try a different set of liquid names and repeat the process , and see if the decisions in the last round still make sense the approach for 1 . 2 may be a ) define a small set of illiquid names b ) apply each of the different models we have to these names c ) sit with traders , get trader ' s intuition on where each illiquid name should price and note this on the spectrum of prices obtained in ( b ) d ) try to determine attributes of the names that may explain the dispersion of the trader prices across the models e ) check if these are similar to the attributes identified for liquid names f ) define a master set of liquid names g ) look for relationships ( by analyzing cross - section of data ) between attributes or prices of illiquid names to those of liquid names once a mapping has been defined for an illiquid name to a set of liquid names and their attributes , then this mapping can be entered into a table , and the pricing can be automated for all names ( in theory ) ! the success will depend on the success of the round - table sessions for the approaches for 1 . 1 and 1 . 2 . building a new fundamental model is always a worthwhile task , but we can get going with the above approaches immediately in parallel with developing any new models that we may build . new models can be added to the suite of existing models . i do not believe there will ever be a single model that will answer all questions for all names , but rather we can refine the mappings and relative choices among models over time , which would mean continuing round - table sessions with traders . limited data makes calibration very hard , so i would continually ask the question  what do we calibrate ?  throughout the discussions for 1 . 1 and 1 . 2 , and this may help guide us to new models . vasant benjamin parsons 06 / 19 / 2000 04 : 11 am to : ect london credit trading cc : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , vasant shanbhogue / hou / ect @ ect , amitava dhar / corp / enron @ enron , steven leppard / lon / ect @ ect , grant masson / hou / ect @ ect , dale surbey / lon / ect @ ect , david a wall / risk mgmt / lon / ect @ ect , jitendra j patel / lon / ect @ ect , oliver gaylard / lon / ect @ ect subject : pricing credit on thousands of names all - our challenge for the next few months is to build an automated system to provide differential pricing on thousands of credits [ 5 , 000 by year - end ] . most of these credits will be illiquid in terms of market price information , making the challenge harder , and the end result more important in terms of competitive pricing advantage . what we need is an overall strategy for how we plan to achieve this from the quantitative perspective . currently we have several models for credit pricing either in use or under development : fmc model ( default probability approach ) . using bloomberg ' s fair market ( par yield ) curves , probabilities are generated from the risky - libor , then default / bankruptcy swap prices computed using expectation methodology . fmc model ( credit spread approach ) . using the fmcs , then directly taking the libor credit spread at each tenor , adjusting for basis and compounding differences . bond model ( fmc approach ) . taking the fmcs as benchmark curves , the model regresses the input bonds ( specific to a name ) on the two best fitting benchmarks . the result is a zero yield curve with the same shape as the fmcs , but with the level tweaked for the specific issuer . prices are then generated using both spread and probability approaches . under testing . bond model ( spline approach ) . taking only the bonds specific to an issuer , the model fits an exponential cubic spline to the zero - coupon price curve , then builds a zero yield curve from this . under testing . market prices . for certain liquid names , or sectors / ratings , cds market prices are used , then recovery and event discount used to get bankruptcy swap prices . kmv . using expected default frequencies ( edfs ) from the kmv model and database , we will build a model to price default swaps , making appropriate risk adjustments . kmv is being installed now , so model will be worked on next . each of these models returns a price ( credit default and bankruptcy ) , and the accuracy of the price depends on many factors - liquidity and regulatory differences between bond and cds markets , recovery assumptions , risk premia , capital charges , etc . the aim will be to accurately price as many liquid names as possible , based upon these models , then use these prices , alongside other financial information , as the backbone to a full automated pricing system . our inputs to the proposed pricing system for a specific name are model and market prices for all issuers , alongside name - specific ' soft ' data from credit reports and financial statements . if the credit is liquid enough , a price will be generated from their own information only . otherwise , the credit will be mapped onto a subset of liquid credits , with financial information and historical price movements providing the mapping and weights . the model price will then be periodically adjusted to align itself with market ( or trader ) prices , and this adjustment will feed back into the weighting and mapping composition . in loose terms , we could think of the system price for an illiquid credit as being a weighted average of liquid market prices ( bonds , equities , default swaps ) , where the weightings are calibrated using credit analysis , financial ratios , etc . the key steps to implementing such a system will be : establishing what exactly we want to ' predict ' - is it a price , a rating , a probability , or a score ? we will need a clean market history to calibrate to , which we only really have for ratings . we will then need to develop a mapping from rating / score to price . getting and cleaning the historical financial and credit data required to calibrate the model . building the mechanics of the model , ie , the calibration methodology . neural nets / fuzzy logic seem the obvious candidates , but which exact methods and software packages to use ? determining an automated methodology for mapping names with limited information into the model . getting the  true  market price , in order to feed back an error . at present such a price exists for very few credits . allocating resources to the development . mckinsey claimed such a system would take 6 - 10 man - months to develop . further ideas or comments are requested , as we need to develop our strategy asap . the model description above is fairly vague , as we don ' t yet have the knowledge needed to fill in the specific details . further help will be especially required on this if we are to continue to move at ' internet speed ' . regards ben;Safe Email

1196;sum : a ( formerly ) productive morphological process ? about 3 weeks ago , i posted in linguist 6-954 a query regarding the status in current english of a compounding process , involving the use of a ` combining form ' ending in - o - , which had given us not only such ethnic / geograhical terms as ` anglo - saxon ' , ` afro - asiatic ' , and ` dano - norwegian ' but ` sociopolitical ' , ` socioeconomic ' , etc . i was prompted in this query by the recent replacement of the label ` afro - american ' by the fuller form ` african american ' and by the appearance in a new edition of a college textbook of the term ` european american ' to mean what i have long referred to as ` euro - american ' . the issue first came to my attention a few years ago through a column in the university of illinois newspaper , in which an undergraduate woman of african ancestry explicitly rejected the label ` black ' on the grounds that it is , technically , inaccurate , the skins of the people in question are merely a darker shade of brown than those of europeans . having said this , she then went on to reject the label ` afro - american ' because she could n't find ` afro ' on a map . as a linguist , i naturally wondered if she was unaware of the general compounding process involved . then a few weeks ago at work i found that the authors of the above-mentioned textbook ( on sociology , if i remember correctly ) had meticulously replaced every instance of the label ` white ' in the previous edition with the expression ` european - american ' . i began wondering if i was seeing a trend . first of all , i would like to thank the following respondents : lynne cahill < lynneca @ cogs . susx . ac . uk > lee hartman < ga5123 @ siucvmb . siu . edu > larry horn < lhorn @ yalevm . cis . yale . edu > james kirchner < jpkirchner @ aol . com > kevin lemoine < lemoine @ mail . utexas . edu > the general consensus seems to be that the ascendency of the full expression ` african - american ' can be dated to a speech by the rev . jesse jackson in the late 80 's . to quote lee hartman : ` i think the entire  phenomenon  can be attributed to a single individual , and with alittle research we could even determine the precise date when he made his announcement . this is a textbook case of  pristine  etymology ( where the historical events giving rise to a word are still alive in the memories of living witnesses ) . ` i ' m referring to an announcement made by jackson to the effect that he felt the term  black  had too many negative connotations , and that he wanted to institute a more dignified term for americans descended from africans . ` i think jackson said explicitly that he briefly considered the term  afro - american  , but he rejected it on the grounds that  afro  was too closely equated with a particular hair-style , and he did n't want a term that would suggest merely  americans who wear afro hair-do 's  . ' a second motivating consideration mentioned by some of my respondents was that the reduction of ` african ' to ` afro - ' involved in the formation of the older ` afro - american ' might be interpreted as deemphasis and might thus be irritating , if not offensive , to people who regard their african heritage as a matter of pride . this is quite plausible , although it is n't consistent throughout the general speech community : it is not the case that every english speaker , in every circumstance , regards the formation of the - o - combining form from some word for the purpose of coining a compound involves the deemphasis of that word or its referent . for instance , in regarding myself as a ` euro - american ' i definitely emphasize the ` euro - ' part . and another of my respondents pointed out progovac ' recent rejection of the label ` serbo - croatian ' in favour of ` serbian / croatian ' on the grounds that the older / more traditional / conven - tional label places too * much * emphasis on the serbian component . on a somewhat parallel note , one of my respondents suggested that the form ` euro - ' might be rejected because , at least to an american , its most obvious association is with the expression ` eurotrash ' , which i have to admit is not part of my experience , i am more accustomed to its usage in europe , in which it tends to connote ` cosmopolitan ' or at least ` pan - european ' as opposed to narrowly nationalistic . on the broader question addressed by my query , there appears to be no evidence that the morphological process of creating combining forms in - o - is itself on the way out in english , only one or two instantiations of it are currently being rejected by some people for sociopolitical reasons . as to the past history of this process in english ( it 's presumably either borrowed from or heavily encouraged by greek ) , i have so far heard very little . best , steven - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - dr . steven schaufele 712 west washington urbana , il 61801 217-344 - 8240 fcosws @ prairienet . org * * * * o syntagmata linguarum liberemini humanarum ! * * * * * * nihil vestris privari nisi obicibus potestis ! * * *;Safe Email

1207;turbine disposition exposure - - mhi f ' s and w 501 d 5 a to all , i ' m very concerned , as i ' m sure you are , about the exposure of holding the mitsubishi units and the westinghouse 501 d . with the market for machines getting softer , the opportunity to sell these units looks increasingly slim . mhi units : i recommend that we seriously evaluate developing a project or projects around the mhi units . to do this , a project may have to underperform financially , but it may be significantly less of a hit than holding the machines for an indefinite time . when this has been suggested , the resonse is that the economics don ' t work for this project . the value of the units is around $ 160 mm and the cost of holding them will only increase . to avoid a major impact i feel it ' s important that we consider this issue on a global enron basis , rather than on a project basis . one potential opportunity would be to put these some of these units into the mid - west project which fred mitro has gotten permitted . other potential projects may also be good vehicles . w 501 d 5 a : we need to reach closure on this unit . as a single unit , this unit may be easier to dispose of . if we can get it out of the legal arena , perhaps we can get siemens - westinghouse to take it back for what we paid . otherwise , we should go ahead and get it equipped with a generator and either sell it or put it into a project . as it stands now , the cost of holding it will be going up monthly . ron tapscott is now the lead for addressing this issue . if the group thinks that the above suggestions have any merit , perhaps we should discuss what has to happen internally to pursue either of these to execution . thanks ! mike;Safe Email

I'm sure this is common knowledge already, but just in case ...http://security.tombom.co.uk/shatter.html   This paper presents a new generation of attacks against Microsoft
   Windows, and possibly other message-based windowing systems. The
   flaws presented in this paper are, at the time of writing,
   unfixable. The only reliable solution to these attacks requires
   functionality that is not present in Windows, as well as efforts on
   the part of every single Windows software vendor. Microsoft has
   known about these flaws for some time, when I alerted them to this
   attack, their response was that they do not class it as a flaw -
   the email can be found here. This research was sparked by comments
   made by Microsoft VP Jim Allchin who stated, under oath, that there
   were flaws in Windows so great that they would threaten national
   security if the Windows source code were to be disclosed. He
   mentioned Message Queueing, and immediately regretted it. However,
   given the quantity of research currently taking place around the
   world after Mr Allchin's comments, it is about time the white hat
   community saw what is actually possible.

1233;Quoting wintermute (cout@eircom.net):> No, as of oh, about a year to a year and a half ago
> SuSE revoked it's free offering of it's retail distro.
> Sometime about the start of the great slump, SuSE pulled
> free release of it's main x86 product.
> 
> So the last free version of SuSE you could get via a Linux Format 
> par example was 7.0 I think.Let's limit the discussion to x86, to simplify.  There are some
additional complications for some of the other architectures.
(Essentially, they make most of the other architectures' ISO images
available gratis, because they aren't selling boxed sets and want the
public to have them anyway.  The ISOs include third-party proprietary
apps, but of necessity not the highly-restricted ones available in 
boxed set editions.)(1) You can get a single-disk ISO9660 image of SuSE evaluation
edition, version 7.0, _lots_ of places, including here:ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/i386/evaluation-7.0/evaluation-7.0.iso(2) You could wget -r (or equivalent) the entire 8.0 FTP Edition (for
lack of an official name for it) from here (or mirror sites):ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/i386/8.0/Please note the restricted rights granted for use of the SuSE-originated
YaST program specifically, stated here:ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/i386/8.0/COPYRIGHT.yastA grant of limited redistribution rights to the distribution as a whole 
(apparently covering the FTP Edition and the Evaluation Edition) is
stated here: ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/README.mirror-policy   Quoting:     please make sure that you meet the following conditions if
     you intend to mirror ftp.suse.com:   - SuSE Linux (YaST in particular) may not be reproduced on
     CDs or other media FOR VALUE. Reproduction for personal
     or educational use is explicitly allowed and encouraged.> I'm not sure on the details of it, but I think SuSE have
> probably done an OpenBSD of the cd they sell?OpenBSD Foundation assert a compilation copyright over the OpenBSD
official ISO9660 image.  A compilation copyright is the copyright
monopoly that, for example, the editor of a set of third-party short
stories receives.  Even though he didn't write any of the constituent
stories, he put creative work into selecting, arranging, and editing
those stories.  The law recognises such efforts as creative works
deserving copyright protection, if there is sufficient creative effort.
(A judge would decide, if someone made a court case of it.)  Courts have
held, on the other hand, that arrangement and publication of
alphabetical telephone listings in a yellow pages telephone directory
(the advertising section) don't have anywhere near enough creative
content to support an overreaching telco's claim of compilation
copyright.  (The court politely said Nice try, in effect.)The OpenBSD Foundation's claim may be a bit of a legal bluff, too.
Theoretically, one could get around it by creating a slightly different
set of ISO9660 images, thereby finessing the claim of compilation
copyright.  But nobody bothers, because OpenBSD Foundation actually 
charges only a very reasonable price for jewel-case sets, and nobody
wants to endure the barrage of hatemail from Theo & co.I've never seen any claim from SuSE of compilation copyright on its ISOs
or distribution as a whole.> I could be wrong, I don't use SuSE so haven't investigated,
> but essentially the only 'free' version of SuSE will be it's
> ftp offering.Again, the FTP Edition and the Evaluation Edition may be redistributed
more-or-less freely, as long as it's not for value.  (Ditto the
live-eval edition, which is a demo only.)  The three boxed sets'
contents may not.-- 
Cheers,              A good man has few enemies, a ruthless man has none.

- but how can we perceive those regularities ? - and how do we reason on the basis of that knowledge if there are no observable constraints on infererring ? - but if there are , where do they come from and how are they actually implemented mentally ?

You aren't the first person to ask this question, but over the last few
years there have been some good answers to this coming from the genetics
research folks.  As I understand it, there is a growing body of genetic
evidence that European immune systems are substantially tougher and more
resistant to a wider range of infectious diseases than those found in other
peoples around the world, including a surprisingly wide range of hereditary
immunities and partial immunities/resistance to common viruses and bacteria
found around the world.  As a result, when the first wholesale mixing of
people from different parts of the world started occurring on a regular
basis, the Europeans fared much better than most others.The standard theory for this is that Europe was the first major region of
the planet to become densely populated and urbanized (to the extent that
they urbanized a thousand years ago).  Because of this, Europe was a
festering cauldron of disease without the benefit of modern sanitation and
medicine for a thousand plus years, much more so than the rest of the world
and suffered from repeated large-scale epidemics and plagues that took
severe tolls on the population.  Modern ethnic Europeans have genetics that
survived a unique and brutal culling process by a rather extensive range of
diseases over dozens of generations.What the geneticists are discovering is that for a great many of the world's
most common infectious diseases, there is a percentage of the ethnically
European population that has hereditary immunity and an even larger segment
that has at least some hereditary resistance compared to people from other
parts of the world.  And for most ethnic Europeans it isn't just one
disease, they have varying levels of genetic resistance to a veritable
cornucopia of infectious diseases.  Because of similarities in the
mechanisms and characteristics of viruses and other pathogens around the
world to ones that Europeans were exposed to, the robust defenses their
genetics provided them against their native diseases frequently imparted
some resistance to diseases which they had never been exposed.Cheers,-James Rogers

ZDNet AnchorDesk NewsletterTHURSDAY, JULY 18, 2002
Why we're changing our publishing schedule
Dear Reader,As of Monday, July 15, AnchorDesk is being published on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, instead of five days a week. The AnchorDesk Weekly newsletter will continued to be published every FridayWhy are we doing this? There are several reasons, but the most important one is giving me a chance do more than just sit behind a desk typing all day in order to meet deadlines.  I've been writing five columns a week for 18 months now, and I'd be lying to you if I didn't admit to being more than a little tired.  Also, I've been on such a short leash that I haven't been able to travel or meet as many people as I'd like. This new schedule means I'll have more time to get out, learn more, see more products, and discover new issues or trends. So it should result in a more interesting and useful AnchorDesk for you.Having additional time also means I will be able to work on several projects I've been assigned, including one that could bear fruit at the Consumer Electronics Show next January. More about that soon, once all the details are nailed down.For now, the new schedule is being called a test, which means it could turn out to be temporary--or maybe not. We'll run it through the end of the summer and see how it works. I appreciate your continued support of AnchorDesk. While the column will be less frequent, I will still be on CNET Radio every weekday at noon PT (or on-demand streaming anytime) and hope you will join me there.Sincerely,
David Coursey

Module:         nfs
Announced:      2002-08-05
Credits:        Mike Junk 
Affects:        All releases prior to 4.6.1-RELEASE-p7

FreeBSD only:   NOI.   BackgroundThe Network File System (NFS) allows a host to export some or all of
its filesystems, or parts of them, so that other hosts can access them
over the network and mount them as if they were on local disks.  NFS is
built on top of the Sun Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework.II.  Problem DescriptionA part of the NFS server code charged with handling incoming RPC
messages had an error which, when the server received a message with a
zero-length payload, would cause it to reference the payload from the
previous message, creating a loop in the message chain.  This would
later cause an infinite loop in a different part of the NFS server
code which tried to traverse the chain.III. ImpactCertain Linux implementations of NFS produce zero-length RPC messages
in some cases.  A FreeBSD system running an NFS server may lock up
when such clients connect.An attacker in a position to send RPC messages to an affected FreeBSD
system can construct a sequence of malicious RPC messages that cause
the target system to lock up.IV.  Workaround1) Disable the NFS server: set the nfs_server_enable variable to NO
   in /etc/rc.conf, and reboot.   Alternatively, if there are no active NFS clients (as listed by the
   showmount(8) utility), just killing the mountd and nfsd processes
   should suffice.2) Add firewall rules to block RPC traffic to the NFS server from
   untrusted hosts.V.   SolutionThe following patch has been verified to apply to FreeBSD 4.4, 4.5, and
4.6 systems.a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.# fetch ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-02:36/nfs.patch
# fetch ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-02:36/nfs.patch.ascb) Apply the patch.# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patchc) Recompile your kernel and modules as described in
 and reboot the
system.VI.  Correction detailsThe following list contains the revision numbers of each file that was
corrected in FreeBSD.Path                                                             Revision

Are applied crypto people suffering higher rates of unemployment than general application programmers? (From my statistically too small sample of acquaintances it might appear so.)If this is so, why is it?- you might think the physical security push following the world political instability worries following Sep 11th would be accompanied by a corresponding information security push -- jittery companies improving their disaster recovery and to a lesser extent info sec plans.- governments are still harping on the info-war hype, national information infrastructure protection, and the US Information Security Czar Clarke making grandiose pronouncements about how industry ought to do various things (that the USG spent the last 10 years doing it's best to frustrate industry from doing with it's dumb export laws)- even Microsoft has decided to make a play of cleaning up it's security act (you'd wonder if this was in fact a cover for Palladium which I think is likely a big play for them in terms of future control points and (anti-)competitive strategy -- as well as obviously a play for the home entertainment system space with DRM)However these reasons are perhaps more than cancelled by:- dot-com bubble (though I saw some news reports earlier that though there is lots of churn in programmers in general, that long term unemployment rates were not that elevated in general)- perhaps security infrastructure and software upgrades are the first things to be canned when cash runs short? - software security related contract employees laid off ahead of full-timers? Certainly contracting seems to be flat in general, and especially in crypto software contracts look few and far between. At least in the UK some security people are employed in that way (not familiar with north america).- PKI seems to have fizzled compared to earlier exaggerated expectations, presumably lots of applied crypto jobs went at PKI companies downsizing. (If you ask me over use of ASN.1 and adoption of broken over complex and ill-defined ITU standards X.500, X.509 delayed deployment schedules by order of magnitude over what was strictly necessary and contributed to interoperability problems and I think significantly to the flop of PKI -- if it's that hard because of the broken tech, people will just do something else.)- custom crypto and security related software development is perhaps weighted towards dot-coms that just crashed.- big one probably: lack of measurability of security -- developers with no to limited crypto know-how are probably doing (and bodging) most of the crypto development that gets done in general, certainly contributing to the crappy state of crypto in software. So probably failure to realise this issue or perhaps just not caring, or lack of financial incentives to care on the part of software developers. Microsoft is really good at this one. The number of times they re-used RC4 keys in different protocols is amazing! Other explanations? Statistics? Sample-of-one stories?Adam -- yes, still employed in sofware security industry, and in addition have been doing crypto consulting since 97 (http://www.cypherspace.net/) if you have any interesting applied crypto projects, reference commissions paid.http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork;Safe Email

I can say I'll make any progress, but I may dabble.  Thanks again for
all your work in this area.  Generalized sequence support has been on
my to do list for about 8 years.--

1293;california update 1 / 22 / 01 executive summary discussions continue today over bill ablx , focus will be on price and term . new legislation introduced today whereby the state will try to save the utilities from bankruptcy by taking ownership of utilities ' hydro assets in exchange for rate increases . wednesday , state receives bids from auction , rate ranges are expected to be between 5 . 5 and 8 . 0 cents per kilowatt hour . mid week , audit findings will be released , audit expected to show pg & e ' s utility subsidiary handed over $ 5 b to the holding company . the holding company used $ 4 . 4 b to pay shareholder dividends and buyback stock . state commissioned study to see who would benefit more in a possible bankruptcy scenario . bankruptcy still very possible for both companies . davis concerned about possible ballot issues and how those may effect futue solutions or  bail out  . legislation there will be continued discussion regarding bill ablx in the senate today . the discussion will focus on the rate cap of 5 . 5 cents per kilowatt hour as well as the term . assemblyman keeley , the author , indicated that he believed 5 . 5 cents was  a fantasy  and impossible to obtain . today , assembly speaker bob hertzberg , d - sherman oaks and assemblyman fred keeley , d - boulder creek will introduce legislation whereby the state would temporary or permanently take both pg & e and edision ' s hydroelectric facilities or transmission lines ( or both ) in exchange for keeping the utilities out of bankruptcy . the state would allow pg & e and edison to impose rate increases , however , the rates would not rise beyond the hikes approved earlier this month by the cpuc as an emergency surcharge . the money collected from consumers would go toward paying off their current debt and the state would then enter into long - term contracts with power generators . under the bill , the state of california would control 10 % of all california ' s electricity . as you can imagine , this legislation has not received unanimous praise . according to recent corporate filings , pg & e ' s hydroelectric plants alone would be valued between $ 3 and $ 5 billion . this amount just happens to be what davis estimates to be the final amount of money the state will have to guarantee once the audit of the utility companies is released and the political pressure is escalated on the parent companies to absorb some of the $ 12 billion in debt . davis is telling people that he thinks the audit will show the state should help with about $ 4 billion in debt , while the utilities , of course , say the full $ 12 billion should be covered . on wednesday , state officials will see the results of sealed bids from energy suppliers for long term contracts and see how close to reality their effort to keep utility rates unchanged for consumers will come . davis insists there are already several bids for his 5 . 5 cents per kilowatt hour ceiling , though few agree with his opinion . a handful of smaller , independent electricity providers with about a 30 % share of california power market , indicated sunday night they would come down to  less than eight cents  or less than half of what they currently charge , in return for the stability of long term contracts . because consumers pay about 6 . 5 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity under current puc rules , any hope california has to  work off  the back debts for these utilities lies in hitting something very close to davis ' price cap , without falling back on higher prices for consumers . the level of bids will be particularly important since bond rating agencies moved to put the state of california on a credit watch on friday , worried that there was no obvious long - term repayment plan for the billions of dollars they are on the hook for spending to keep the lights on in the state . utility ' s audit by the middle of this week , california auditors will release their findings about how much money pg & e and socal edison actually owe to institutions outside their own holding company structure . this will define the limits of what the state will guarantee , if they guarantee any of the debt . the truly explosive part of the audit may be its findings that the two companies used billions of dollars from consumers to buy back their own stock in recent years . a source with knowledge of the audits said the audit is expected to show that in the last three years , pg & e ' s utility subsidiary handed over about $ 5 billion to the holding company . of that total , the holding company used $ 4 . 4 billion to pay shareholder dividends and buyback shares of its stock . another finding from the audit shows that state helped caused the current power crisis when regulators , at the time of deregulation ( under the direction of former r - gov . pete wilson ) , forced the two utilities to sell at least half of their power - generating plants . auditors are expected to say that if the utilities still owned all these plants , electricity would cost only 7 cents a kilowatt hour , compared with over 30 cents an hour on average in december and january . bankruptcy the threat of bankruptcy is still very real for both utilities . senior advisors said that these utilities were on the path often followed by utility companies that ended in bankruptcy . as all the parties involved hunker down for another intensely political week , they all remain determined to avoid bankruptcy , but to push this as close to the brink as possible in the hopes of squeezing out an advantage . under such conditions , the risks of one or more of the players fumbling and triggering the great unknowable outcome of bankruptcy , is still quite high . california ' s political leaders order a series of independent analyses to determine who would suffer most in a case of bankruptcy , the state or the two utilities . the short answer was that no one has any idea . below are the findings of the report and some of the possible scenarios that would face a bankruptcy judge : 1 ) would the companies be eligible for chapter 11 style temporary bankruptcy ? some of the advisors thought that pg & e and edison ' s finances were so bad that chapter 11 style temporary bankruptcy may not even be an option . advisors said that a bankruptcy judge might take a good look at the corporate debt load and decide that reorganization would do no good and order the companies into full liquidation . this would most certainly be guaranteed chaos . 2 ) could the bankruptcy court actually force the puc to raise the price of electricity to consumers ? the legal basis for passing on rate increases to consumers is a lot less solid than originally thought , particularly if there is widespread public outrage directed at the electricity companies . and there is still the question of the unilateral power of a bankruptcy judge . 3 ) if the bankruptcy judge takes his job of protecting corporate assets seriously and finds that pg & e and edison cannot afford to buy electricity , he could order them to stop buying it and thus lead to massive power outages . 4 ) if the utilities go into bankruptcy , the first creditors in line would be the lenders and bondholders with collateral pledges . the state could become almost the last creditor in line as it is just another electricity supplier ( one of the reasons why suppliers won ' t sell electricity on credit to these companies now ) . 5 ) if the two companies went bankrupt , it would be the largest bankruptcies in history , straining just about everyone involved in the process . 6 ) the corporate approval allowing the parent company to segregate assets from the utility by the ferc for pg & e and already in place for edison may be far less effective than the utilities or the ratings agencies currently think . this is particularly true if this week ' s audit shows the two corporations transferring billions of dollars in the last few years into stock buybacks and shareholder dividend payments . davis opinion polls show that governor gray davis is getting high marks for his job , and the utilities are increasingly viewed as the culprits . one of davis concern ' s is , according to a senior official in the governor ' s office , that a deal is carved out that triggers a popular ballot initiative which is so anti - utility and anti - business that it cripples future growth in the state . according to a senior official ,  no one thought howard jarvis and his property tax initiative would succeed in destroying our education system , but he did , with one just ballot line and a lot of popular revulsion . the threat of direct , popular action is at least as large now as then .  consumer advocate harvey rosenfield is already threatening to draw up a ballot initiative at the first sign that individual electricity consumers are being asked to help the utility companies repay their debt through higher rate - payer bills . this official goes on to say ,  the anger at utility companies is so high here , that almost anything rosenfield could think of would pass and we couldn ' t do anything about it .  this threat has begun to complicate the one escape route on the debt front that had always appeared wide open to political leaders - - floating a bond issue or a guarantee for the money owed to institutions outside the corporate holding structure , and then letting the companies work that off with profits over the next several years .;Safe Email

the uncontrollable forest fires were the result of the Forest Service's
long-standing 10:00 A.M. policy, in place until the decision in 1963 to
switch over to let-it-burn.The 10:00 A.M. policy was based on theories about forest management from
Europe, and wasn't as applicable to the American wilds. So, we went from a
policy of containment for 100 years to one of letting things burn unless they
directly threatened property.40 years after the end of the containment policy there is still a lot of stuff
left to burn. I can't imagine that artificially planted replacement
forests, with dense stands of identical trees, help that much either. I would be comfortable laying the fault for these contributing factors
squarely with the Forest Service. I would put the blame for many burned homes
upon the people who chose to build their dwelling with an unwise combination of
materials, location, and landscaping.--

1306;comparative method these are notes after the recent discussions of karl teeter , amramer , sally thomason , after the aaa meetings sessions on distant language reconstructions , and also in response to part of mr . poser 's message of 14 december . first , most of the discussion of karl teeter i can agree with wholeheartedly except in the use of any of his criteria as absolutes . even grammatical things can be borrowed ( as sally pointed out ) . people do in practice * * * correctly * * * accept a language family such as uto - aztecan as essentially proven , even when no grammar has been written for the proto-language , or when only parts of a grammar are written . on the one hand , nobody would be disturbed much if it turned out that one of the assumed uto - aztecan languages was originally from another family , with truly massive borrowing from uto - aztecan . the overall hypothesis of a uto - aztecan family would not be shaken . on the other hand , asking the question how much of the grammar of the proto-language has to be written reveals the non-absoluteness of the criterion . only a tiny bit ? that might be subject to one of the special cases in which some morphology and other grammar were borrowed ( sally 's general type of example ) . so , again , karl is right in general , but wrong if any single criterion is taken as an absolute ( unless circularly many criteria are combined by feats of legalese into a single criterion ) . i would like to modify amramer 's statement in exactly the same spirit : ) we cannot demand a detailed morphological reconstruction ) until the languages are accepted as related . this is too strong . it is not quite the same as ramer 's ) but surely he does not mean that a comparative grammar is a ) prerequisite to a reconstruction , it is part of a reconstruction . in practice , an extensive comparative grammar is indeed written as part of a reconstruction ( ramer 's second wording above , not his first above ) , but it is not likely to be written unless * * * both * * * of the following two conditions are fulfilled : 1 ) the languages are in fact related ( makes the grammar easier to write ) 2 ) enough scholars believe that the languages might be related and so put effort into establishing their links . it is some unwarranted discouragement of the second which needs to be dealt with in our field . ramer is right that some linguists do discourage attempts to prove what has not already been proven . no risk-taking , in other words . good researchers , attempting to write a grammar of altaic for example , will report all of their results , both for genetic relatedness , for borrowing , and for a host of other questions they will not even have thought of when they started their research . some researchers evaluate only the hypothesis they started with . very often the differences of viewpoint amount to nothing more than an elevation of what one does oneself into the  true  or  real  work of the field , instead of recognizing that it takes a number of different contributions . i will illustrate from karl teeter 's recent messages , with no malice intended , because i am absolutely sure he intends none himself . in modifying his wording to take account of amramer 's point that of course people do properly classify languages on the basis of phonological correspondences , teeter writes on 10 december :  since it is clear that everybody 's first approximation to linguistic history begins with such classification . what i say is just that you cannot reconstruct languages on this basis .  ( please note the words  first approximation  in this . that you cannot reconstruct languages on the bases of classification alone seems to me a tautology . ) later in the same message , teeter reverts to the more absolute statement :  on the contrary , my contention ( not my invention ) , is that the only way to establish that languages are related is to write a grammar of the proto - langauge and show how it developed into different later grammars .  ( please note the words  the only way  and  establish  . using these words does not change the fact that uto - aztecan is * * * correctly * * * accepted as a proven family without teeter 's criteria being satisfied . ) on 8 december , teeter wrote : )  systematic correspondences of sounds in the vocabularies  may prove ) a connection between languages , which is certainly an interesting ) first step , but there the real work of comparative grammar starts : [ then teeter mentions four possible explanations , only one genetic ] ) until one can exclude the first three factors , one has proven ) nothing at all regarding genetic relationship . teeter discounts the enormous work of discovering likely language families in the first place , trivializes that as not the  real work  and establishment of systematic sound correspondences as proving  nothing at all  regarding genetic relationship . on the contrary , that does prove a grouping as a legitimate candidate for genetic relationship , and often the nature of the sound correspondences found will also have made one or more of the alternatives less probable . the work of comparative-historical grammarians is  real work  . so is the work of those who spend enormous hard-working hours sifting potential cognates to discover potential sound correspondences . do teeter and others really have no knowledge of how much work that takes ? at no stage is something ever completely proven in an absolute sense ( not even after a comparative grammar is written , because of the potential for undiscovered problems of the kind noted by sally thomas ) . all stages of the process contribute to the end result . all stages are equally  the real work  . proof is always incremental , not nothing , not complete and absolute . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * i turn next to mr . poser 's message , and to other information gleaned at the aaa meetings . perhaps mr . poser will be surprised that i am enthusiastically in favor of anyone correcting any errors in any claims of language relationship or language structure , including mr . poser 's mention of kimball correcting errors in muskogean , even or especially if that means that a greenberg claim about pronouns in amerind is weakened . it is actually claims about morphology where i expect greenberg is least likely to have succeeded in contributing something . i thank mr . poser for the bibliography i can check against my lists of corrections and for this note on muskogean pronouns . i also agree with mr . poser that the criticism of errors in data does not rely on the mere authority of the critic . ( that was not my point about appeals to authority , so one of mr . poser 's paragraphs was not directly relevant . my earlier point about appeals to authority remains . ) i did not indicate ( as mr . poser 's message suggests ) that critics complained of errors when they could not back them up . what i did say was that they claimed greenberg 's errors made the method worthless , without bothering to test whether correction of the errors would actually lead to a change in his conclusions , and without promptly providing the data so others could carry out such a test . ) from conversations , i would judge some are still reluctant to face this test , the one required by a part of their claims . ( even if their claims on this point prove wrong in some degree , because the conclusions of greenberg 's method mostly remain the same even after errors of those kinds are corrected , it still will not follow that greenberg 's methods produce valid results on a regular basis . please notice how careful it is important to be with notions of proof for or against anything . ) in conversation with bob rankin at the recent aaa meetings i indicated i was glad greenberg had made the attempt at morphology , with his 3rd - person alternation between / y / and / t / as a putative relic irregularity , but i was equally likely to end up believing that he had discovered a new typological fact , a preference for these unmarked segments and recurring conditions under which they might alternate in more or less the same way , which might indicate that the same phenomenon could arise by chance repeatedly . we are always dealing simultaneously with possibilities of genetic relationship or convergent evolution . as a general warning about the danger of throwing out hypotheses too early because they are  obviously  cases of chance lookalikes or convergent evolution , an article  common pathways of illumination  by stephen jay gould of harvard , in natural history magazine , december 1994 pp . 10-20 , discusses the origins of eyes in different phyla of the animal kingdom . he states that this had been a classic case in biology , used to show convergent evolution of originally unrelated organs to serve the same function . however , the dna specialists have gotten their hands on this one , and apparently it is * * * the same dna * * * which is regulating important parts of the production of eyes in these various phyla , barring of course a few changes in a few amino acid codes . this dna is therefore genetically inherited ( and we are talking as far back as the common node on the family tree of drosophila fruit flies , squids , and humans ! ) . if this line of argument holds up , we have quite a revolution in thinking on our hands . ( such thinking can of course go far overboard too . )  chance lookalikes  certainly do exist massively . sound symbolism is a typological basis for their recurrence . the too-easy use of  chance lookalikes  to reject comparisons can however also be just like the too-easy use of  substrate  and many other ways of purporting to explain phenomena , but in reality merely naming them without doing the hard work of really explaining them . as another factual contribution to the discussion of greenberg 's errors , bob rankin clarified for me at the aaa meetings that he had looked at greenberg 's original notebooks , and that apparently what happened is that greenberg had a single flexible flap in his notebook bearing the language names , and sheets which he matched up against that to enter data for particular lexical items . this is a mechanism subject to errors of the two pieces of paper slipping vertically relative to each other , and in fact there were rather a large number of such errors . it was errors of rows rather than of columns ( as i loosely had assumed without ever bothering to ask if rows or columns ) . mr . poser originally asked on 9th november whether  limitations [ of the comparative method ] had been and were being used to justify resistance to proposals of emote relationships . . .  please take careful note of this wording , as mr . poser changed the wording in his message of 14 december , when he asserts no example has been given . i gave mr . poser an eyewitness account satisfying the wording he used . i stand by that eyewitness account . ( i do not like naming names ever in these matters , but mr . poser 's assertion could be answered only by an eyewitness account . ) none of mr . poser 's supposed rebuttal in his recent message is at all relevant to that claim , though it is relevant to another claim , an absurd one , that i did not make . ( as in his previous message , mr . poser mixes several different wordings of what are quite radically different hypotheses . any extended discussion of these variants would not be relevant to any of our central points , so i omit them . ) to be specific about that absurd claim i did * not * make , i quite agree with mr . poser that some of the same people also criticize greenberg 's hypotheses based on the factual data . i have never denied that , and in fact took pains to refer to other good work by the same people , and have always emphasized the importance of having corrections of data . mr . poser 's conclusion was : ) it thus appears , as i thought , that there are no real examples of perceived ) limitations of the comparative method being used as the basis for rejecting ) proposals of genetic affiliation . since i gave an eyewitness account of such an example of the perceived limitations being used as one basis for rejecting proposals of genetic affiliation , mr . poser can only maintain his original assertion by converting it into a different assertion as he has here , namely that there is no case of a person using those perceived limitations as  the  ( read  the only  ) basis for rejecting such proposals . i will simply repeat that in the case to which i was eyewitness , the tone of the presentation was quite clear that the absurdity of the time depth was sufficient * * * in and of itself * * * to rule out the legitimacy of attempting such distant comparison . ( a critique of errors in greenberg 's data is not directly relevant to this point , even if engaged in by the same person . ) apparently mr . poser wants his allies to be persons who not only do good work , but also do nothing wrong . but we cannot posit such a division between the  holy  and the  unclean  , like the caste distinctions of traditional india . no one has the right to take such a position vis a vis other good-faith researchers , however much they may disagree with data , results , or methods . i gather from some conversations at the aaa that some of the people involved have become more moderate since the earlier years in these matters , at least in their public statements . that is certainly all to the good . there are also small beginnings of developments of method which may turn out to be relevant to our current limitations . i am perplexed by mr . poser 's discussion of the supposed rule of using only three-consonant matches never merely two-consonant matches . although i used siouxan - yuchi , because some amerindianists are considering this , the point does not depend in the slightest on whether one believes these two particular nodes are related or not . perhaps someone can propose another alternative ( i would suggest looking for one in tibeto - burman , where perhaps only one consonant , one vowel , and tone would be available , and yet the genetic relations are in some cases secure . ) i agree with mr . poser that it is better to have three consonants than two , and precisely because it helps to avoid chance resemblances . as i stated in the previous message . that means that the only difference between us is that mr . poser will consider treating the preferred method ( 3 consonants ) as the only permitted one : ) if ( probably contrary to fact ) , matches of three consonants are ) necessary to exclude chance , . . . i do not see why we should be ) unwilling , in that case , to conclude either that they are not ) related or that , if they are , the relationship is not demonstrable . the problem here is the notion that such a particular rule * could even conceivably * be  necessary to exclude chance  . no rule is necessary to exclude chance . a large number of procedures and methods can * * * help * * * to exclude chance . except in the most difficult cases of all , probably most single rules can be violated , and there will still be enough other ways of excluding chance that a good result can be achieved . it is this fossilization in the response to expansions of the methods available as part of  the comparative method  which is damaging to increasing the rigor as well as the power of our field . it is encouraging to see sessions on distant language relationships . i firmly believe some of these sessions would not be occurring nor would there be so much work on studying methods , if greenberg had not published that book . some of the growth of interdisciplinary cooperation and communication was also in the process of happening anyway , and greenberg just accidentally published at this time . ( i am not trying to credit him with causing all of this interest . ) i particularly liked john colarusso 's contribution to the eurasian session , because he outlined his views on why distant language comparisons are very difficult because of the progressive loss of data , yet he is not in the business of criticizing people who attempt these . he is in the business of himself contributing to a deepening of both linguistic and mythological comparisons as much as he can in areas which are still to a great extent uncharted . johanna nichols also provoked much thought with her methods , and ways of integrating more information on peripheries vs . centers of innovation and residue of repeated waves of innovation visible even at the peripheries , as a pattern to look for in projecting a homeland backwards in time . i am somewhat skeptical about very distant language comparisons which involve only identities of sound correspondence , precisely because it is so easy for this approach to select a very old but still relatively more recent layer of borrowings ( more recent than the node on the family tree we may be struggling to find a way to reach ) . as greenberg pointed out , an increase in the number of conditioning contexts over time , once it approaches the number of lexical items available for comparison , leads to the result that there are virtually no recurrences of exactly the same sound correspondences . please see a separate message on how we can sharpen our tools to deal with this , titled  typology of historical change  . this means that i start out somewhat skeptical about alan bomhard 's nostratic and similar comparisons , precisely because he uses only or preferentially sound correspondences of identity . but that may be my personal bias , and i may end up granting that such a strictness of sound correspondences can actually work over great time depths . i cannot presume to know . there was one session i did not attend but report here from the abstract , in which researchers reported results of mitochondrial dna studies of the various native american populations . as expected , eskimo and athabaskan were separable ( one variety each ? ) . the remainder of native american populations shared four varieties of mitochondrial dna , either without subgrouping , or perhaps in two major subgroups . bob rankin did attend and says that the authors in their presentation had come down on the side of two major subgroups . population genetics need not match language directly , but the data is still at least interesting and obliquely relevant . . . lloyd anderson;Safe Email

- generex biotechnology ( nasdaqsc : gnbt ) has developed oral - lyn  , an oral insulin spray for the treatment of diabetes , thereby replacing insulin injections . - - after 10 years of development , oral - lyn  has been found to be as effective as injected insulin and is ready for commercialization . - - sales could start as early as the first half of 2005 in south america . canada and europe is the next target market , with u . s . and europe to follow . - - diabetes is growing at epidemic rates . hundreds of millions suffer from type 1 , type 2 or pre - diabetes . even modest penetration of the worldwide diabetes market would translate into revenues in the billion - dollar range . - - generex  s delivery system , rapidmist  , has the potential to replace injected drugs , including morphine , fentanyl , heparin and flu vaccine . why buy now generex biotechnology is a toronto - based , delaware corporation with a market - ready solution to a central challenge in diabetes treatment  ending the pain and hassle of insulin injections . ever since scientists early in the 20 th century learned that diabetes was caused by the body  s inability to produce a normal supply of insulin , patients have had to administer insulin by injection . alternatives that have been developed in recent years  pumps or needle - less  pens   are still invasive and / or expensive . pharmaceutical companies have tried to develop a truly non - invasive insulin product that is pain - free , easy to use and free from serious side effects . among today  s competing technologies , only oral - lyn  , an insulin spray to treatment diabetes , meets all those tests . after 10 years of development , oral - lyn  is ready for market and is set to produce enormous revenue growth for the company . generex is little known outside a small community of investors focused on drug delivery and diabetes treatment . in the next few months , however , the expected commercial entry of oral - lyn  in south america could raise generex  s profile sharply , with a commensurate rise in their share price . small companies in drug and medical - device development are , of course , inherently high -

day shipping anywhere in the world : $ 50  also ,  here are some details on the new labeling facility in signalyze ( version 3 . 0 , macintosh - specific software ) . this may be of use to people working in prosody . levels the signalyze labeling operation works by levels . for each label , you specify a level , such as  segment  ,  syllable  ,  phrase  etc . each level has its own label color and its own , user-definable name . labels are marked for their level by a number placed in front of the label name ( e . g . ,  4 : its  , means that the label  its  is marked for the fourth level ) . what gets labeled you can label either points in the signal or selected portions of the signal . the labels for selected portions are placed at the center of the selection and are marked by angular brackets (  ) . . . (  ) . re-editing , adding and deleting labels labels can be re-edited , new labels can be added anywhere in the signal , and labels can be deleted individually or for an entire signal . reproduce labeled segment while the label is open for editing , you can play the selected portion of the signal by doing command - y . if you ' re labeling a selection , and if you ' ve set the audio to play signal selections , you ' ll hear the segment which you ' re about to label . align labels you can choose any of nine different vertical positions for placing labels . when you close a label with a click in the close rectangle or with return , the label automatically  snaps  to the nearest standard position . save labels the label information is saved as a tab - delimited text file with the extension  . lbl  . it is stored in the same folder as the signal file . label format the label format is in the public domain and is fully documented . it is available on the signalyze servers ( see below ) . transparent saving and opening open file operations on signal files that have accompanying  . lbl  text files cause the label information to be read into signalyze . save file operations on signals with labeling information automatically saves the labels in the same folder as the signal . save file operations for signals without labeling information erases whatever label file may have existed in the folder . label in phonetics you can use any phonetic or normal font in the labels . however for phonetics , it is recommended stick to sigpalfont ( the shareware font supplied with signalyze ) . sigpalfont preserves the numbers and angular brackets you need to indicate labeling levels , which is usually not possible with other phonetic fonts . search by label or by level you can search for labels using either a given labeling level or the label 's name . you can specify two separate search patterns . switch between the two patterns with the shift-lock key . more info and demo information on signalyze version 3 . 0 is available as follows : by ftp : ftp macfl4082 . unil . ch or ftp 130 . 223 . 104 . 31 login anonymous by gopher server : name of machine : gopher . unil . ch , find  europe  and  switzerland  , select  university of lausanne  , select  autres gophers de l3unil  , select  faculte des lettres  , select  laboratoire d3analyse informatique de la parole ( laip )  , select  speech analysis and speech synthesis  , select  signalyze  prof . eric keller ( new email address : eric . keller @ imm . unil . ch ) laboratoire d ' analyse / / ^     = = \ \ informatique de la parole ( laip ) / / / \       lettres , universite de lausanne / / / / \ \     = = / / ch-1015 lausanne , switzerland / / / / = = = \ \     fax + 41 21 6924639 / + 41 21 692 4510 / / = = = = / / \ \      . 6 . ucla - uppsala analysis package ( to run on macrecorder files )  write to : software manager , phonetics lab , linguistics dept , ucla , los angeles , ca 90024-1543 for our order form . it 's $ 5 for just this disk .

1338;Use the GUI and don't delete files, use the other option, whats it called
again, the dustbin or something ,-)Conor who only knows about symbolic links ,-))I'm pretty sure that I have a softlink from
/mnt/public/mnt/public/downloads/Linux/wasteCPU/setiathome to
/home/cwynne/setiThe /mnt/pub....../seti.. directory resides on an external raidvolume and
/home/../seti is on the internal IDE2 drive. 
So I dont have to cd around the gaf. I suppose that would count as across
different devices. If you're wondering [probably not] why /mnt/public is there twice, its
because I restored from tapebackup and I didn't know that it keeps the
directory structure. I know now ,-)Actually, how can I fix that quickly and easily? I thought about firstly
mv'ing the structure to /tmp. Then copying it back again but I'm sure some
wee genius knows a quickie solution. Mind you I never even bothered trying a
its not a priority now that its all linked anyway. CW--------------------------------
 hum.  interesting variation on the classic technique of
 redefining `rm' to `mv' the files into `./.trash/' (or
 with a prefix of `#' or a suffix of `~', the variations
 are endless).  these classic techniques only provide a
 means to roll back accidental `rm's, so there is still
 considerable scope for data lost as there are other ways
 of deleting files --- which is not a problem for this
 hard link idea. but, like the classic techniques, there is no rolling
 back of accidental overwrites. ( rolling back overwrites reminds me of the snapshot
  facility on NetWork Appliance fileservers.  and of the
  various versioning filesystems which appeared --- and
  then vanished? --- over the years.... ) one severe(?) gotcha is some files shouldn't have any
 hard links.  both RCS *,v (and hence CVS) and SCCS s.*
 files are like this --- the RCS(/CVS?)/SCCS toolsets
 complain if there are hard links.cheers,

1341;update on lodi and wheeler ridge storage projects western undeterred by grueling regulatory process expressing frustration but continuing its resolve , texas - based western hub properties is ironing out some  technical issues  of financing with california regulators and now expects to start construction in february on its delayed lodi gas storage field in northern california . the merchant storage project will be operating by this time next year , said western hub ' s california - based manager , jim fossum , who added that with faster approvals , the project could have been in service during this summer ' s electricity generating crunch and the current gas and power shortages . despite the regulatory struggle , he said the company still plans to go through with its other california storage project near bakersfield and the natural gas hub called wheeler ridge . western has acquired leases on the property it needs and will start more detailed engineering of the proposed site over the first three to six months of next year . the company intends to make a filing with state regulators in summer of 2001 . in both the approved lodi project ( see daily gpi , may 19 ) and the proposed wheeler ridge storage field , western is not concerned about lining up customers , said fossum . the projects are not contingent on contracts , he said .  now that we are a bona fide ( certified plant ) utility under the california public utilities commission , we are getting some technical things worked out with the commission staff and nailing down the last small pieces of property , fossum said .  everything is basically ready to go at lodi   we have to file with them documents that verify certain aspects of the project ' s financing . we can ' t move ahead with the financing until the cpuc approves it .  if we had not encountered all of the roadblocks that we have had , we could have helped with the problems this last summer , and we could be helping with problems right now .  he added that the project would not be operational in time to have any impact on the upcoming summer electricity demand and corresponding heavy natural gas demand to fuel power plants . lodi and the wheeler ridge storage project are being designed as high - deliverability storage facilities . lodi will have about 9 bcf of working capacity , building to 12 bcf . initially , fossum said , lodi should have about 400 mmcf / d injection capability and 500 mmcf / d withdrawal . in the southern half of the state , western for some time has been doing reservoir studies near wheeler ridge and now has a  couple of reservoirs that we think might work ,  fossum said .  we ' re in the preliminary planning phase .  the wheeler ridge project would have an ultimate working capacity of 12 to 16 bcf and similar 500 mmcf / d deliverability at its peak . he said western hopes to have something operational in the wheeler ridge area by the end of 2002 .;Safe Email

1350;eia ' s latest forecast of pricing and supply for the winter eia predicts supply shortfall will linger through winter the energy information administration said yesterday in its september short - term energy outlook it is projecting natural gas prices at the wellhead will increase by about 87 % this winter ( october - march ) compared to last winter . residential prices for gas are expected to rise on average by 27 % compared to last year . for the entire year , the average wellhead price for natural gas is projected to be $ 3 . 40 / mcf , the highest annual wellhead price on record ( in inflation - adjusted terms , it would be the highest annual average price since 1985 ) . the short - term supply constraints that are currently hindering the industry ' s ability to meet storage and power generation demand at the same time are likely to continue into the heating season , eia said . storage levels could end up being about 8 % below the five - year average of about 3 , 000 bcf by the start of winter if net injections continue at 10 % below historically average rates through the remainder of the refill season . the effects of increased drilling for gas are not expected to appear in the form of significantly increased production until after the next heating season , according to the agency ' s report .  for now , we are continuing to maintain a conservative view of possible increases in domestic gas production for 2000 and 2001 , with assumed increases of 0 . 5 % and 1 % , respectively , for this year and next . . . ,  the eia report stated .  on the other hand , the u . s . natural gas rig count on aug . 25 was at a recent high of 794 rigs . exploration and production budgets for many natural gas producers are expected to increase sharply in 2000 and 2001 , spurred by higher prices and greatly improved current and expected revenues from producing assets . also on the positive side , data from the texas railroad commission suggest that , through may , year 2000 gas production increased , if only slightly ( 0 . 4 % ) . this signifies a turnaround ( however modest ) in a key producing region . very high gas drilling rates , including a record - setting pace in deep offshore gulf of mexico , confirm that increasingly positive results for domestic gas production are under way .  imports are projected to rise by about 12 % next year primarily because of the 1 . 35 bcf / d alliance pipeline coming on line next month . meanwhile the demand outlook remains bullish at 4 . 2 % annual growth . in 2001 , however , the forecast has been revised downward to 2 . 5 % growth because of higher than expected natural gas prices . the industrial sector is the leading sector for demand increases in 2000 at 9 . 3 % , while electric utility demand is expected to decline by 4 . 0 % primarily because of power plant sales . for the power generation sector as a whole , gas demand is expected to grow 6 . 5 % this year and 1 . 5 % in 2001 . eia said the reduced growth rate next year is largely due to the reversal in relative prices of fuel oil and natural gas , which began in august , with fuel oil gaining the price advantage as gas prices continued to rise . gas demand this winter is expected to be up by 5 . 7 % compared to last winter if weather is normal . normal weather implies a 12 % rise in heating degree - days compared with last winter .;Safe Email

1359;http://www.guardian.co.uk/religion/Story/0,2763,806744,00.htmlEvangelicals' threat to new archbishopDirect action threat over liberal views on sexualityStephen Bates, religious affairs correspondent
Tuesday October 8, 2002
The GuardianEvangelical fundamentalists last night stepped up their campaign to oust
Rowan Williams, the incoming Archbishop of Canterbury, before he even takes
up his post, by threatening to take direct action against him.
The council of the Church Society, the Church of England's oldest
evangelical body, joined a younger evangelical pressure group called Reform,
which is also opposed to Dr Williams, in calling on him to recant his
supposedly liberal views on sexuality or stand down.
Following an emergency meeting, the 167-year-old society, whose leaders met
the archbishop last week, proclaimed their continued opposition to his
appointment and called on all Anglicans to spurn him.
The move is the latest stage of an increasingly aggressive attempt to
destabilise the new archbishop, whose leftwing political views are regarded
with deep suspicion by the conservative fringes of the evangelical movement.
Some evangelicals object to Dr Williams's acknowledgement that he has
ordained a gay priest, something many bishops have done, and that those who
have sex outside marriage need not necessarily be spurned. The new
archbishop has repeatedly assured them that he respects the canons of the
church.
Nevertheless, the society said: It is clear that he prefers his private
judgment to the voice of scripture, to the voice of tradition and to the
common mind of the church. As such he can only be a focus of disunity.
The council... called upon loyal Anglicans to pray specifically that Rowan
Williams would see the error in his teaching, change his views or stand
down, it said.
The society claimed to have drawn up an action plan, including calling on
bishops and primates of the 70 million worldwide Anglican communion, of
which archbishops of Canterbury are the leaders, to distance themselves from
Dr Williams's doctrinal and ethical position. It promised it would be
taking steps towards appropriate direct action.
It added that Dr Williams remained on the editorial board of a journal
called Theology and Sexuality which, six months ago, published articles
allegedly commending homosexual behaviour.
Despite its claim, the society does not represent the common mind of the
church. Dr Williams, currently Archbishop of Wales, was chosen by the crown
appointments commission of church members, including evangelicals, and his
appointment was endorsed by the prime minister and the Queen.
He is due to succeed George Carey, who retires this month, and will be
formally enthroned at Canterbury cathedral in February.
Asked what form direct action might take, the Rev George Curry, the
society's chairman, said: Watch this space. Presumably it could involve a
small minority of parishes repudiating the new archbishop and seeking
alternative oversight or even demonstrations at services where Dr Williams
is present.
Church of England bishops, who have hitherto largely kept their heads down
during the row, are meeting next week to discuss their response to the
evangelical extremists' challenge, which appears to have grown in the
absence of a robust rebuttal.
A letter by senior theologians in today's Guardian, however, repudiates the
evangelicals' tactics, calling them unseemly and contrary to biblical
teaching.
On the BBC's Thought for the Day yesterday, Angela Tilby, vice-principal of
Westcott House, Cambridge, accused Dr Williams's opponents of presumption
and blackmail. It is in fact a thoroughly aggressive way to behave. It is
attempting to force an issue by emotional violence... manipulating to get
your way is often preferable to painstaking negotiation, she said.
Last week, Dr Williams said he was deeply saddened. Matters of sexuality
should not have the priority or centrality that Reform and the Church
Society have tried to give them. The archbishop cannot withdraw his
appointment since so many, including evangelicals, have urged him to take
the post... the archbishop believes it to be his duty under God.

1361;like HP is using the DMCA to prevent full disclosure of security vulnerablities. This is not a good precedent... ----- Forwarded message from Vladimir Katalov -----From: Vladimir Katalov Reply-To: Vladimir Katalov Organization: ElcomSoft Co.Ltd. Subject: [DMCA_Discuss] Security warning draws DMCA threat Date: Wed, 31 Jul 2002 15:04:26 +0400 http://news.com.com/2100-1023-947325.html?tag=fd_topBy Declan McCullagh Staff Writer, CNET News.com July 30, 2002, 4:48 PM PTWASHINGTON--Hewlett Packard has found a new club to use to pound researchers who unearth flaws in the company's software: the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.Invoking both the controversial 1998 DMCA and computer crime laws, HP has threatened to sue a team of researchers who publicized a vulnerability in the company's Tru64 Unix operating system.In a letter sent on Monday, an HP vice president warned SnoSoft, a loosely organized research collective, that it could be fined up to $500,000 and imprisoned for up to five years for its role in publishing information on a bug that lets an intruder take over a Tru64 Unix system.HP's dramatic warning appears to be the first time the DMCA has been invoked to stifle research related to computer security. Until now, it's been used by copyright holders to pursue people who distribute computer programs that unlock copyrighted content such as DVDs or encrypted e-books.If HP files suit or persuades the federal government to prosecute, the company could set a precedent that stifles research into computer security flaws, a practice that frequently involves publishing code that demonstrates vulnerabilities. The DMCA restricts code that is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing protection of copyrighted works.On July 19, a researcher at SnoSoft posted a note to SecurityFocus.com's popular Bugtraq mailing list with a hyperlink to a computer program letting a Tru64 user gain full administrator privileges. The researcher, who goes by the alias Phased, said in the message: Here is the warez, nothing special, but it does the job.That public disclosure drew the ire of Kent Ferson, a vice president in HP's Unix systems unit, who alleged in his letter on Monday that the post violated the DMCA and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.[...]_______________________________________________ ------------------------ http://www.anti-dmca.org ------------------------DMCA_Discuss mailing list DMCA_Discuss@lists.microshaft.org http://lists.microshaft.org/mailman/listinfo/dmca_discuss----- End forwarded message ----- http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork;Safe Email

1366;update : ffvols ted , an update on the implementation for ffvols : ( 1 ) in comparing 6 days of historical var calculations ( with that of the implied ) for agg - gas , we have found that the historical var calculations are consistently lower over this period , by roughly 17 mm . the implied volatilities are much higher at this period , anticipating strong winter prices . ( 2 ) at this time , the consensus is not to relase the historical implementation into production , and the official line to traders will be that the method is still in testing . the historical var is 19 . 2 mm and the implied is 37 mm for effective date of 09 / 25 . ( 3 ) further testing is in progress on a hybrid methodology ( which i mentioned last week , whereby historical vols are scaled by the ratio of prompt to historical - prompt volatilities ) , to atleast capture some implied / forward effects . tanya ' s analysis on a fictitious portfolio indicates higher var numbers , but poorer backtesting in comparison to the historical approach . this approach serves as an intermediate , and seems appropriate in periods such as the current one , wherein the historical numbers might be considerably lower than those of the implied . ( 4 ) winston will start testing using these hybrid vols , and if the results are deemed satisfactory , that will be the production methodology . of course , we will obtain all var numbers concurrently to serve as different indicators and beacons of risk . the production number will hopefully be a sensible compromise of the different methods . regards naveen;Safe Email

1371;steve cooper voicemail - 2 / 14 / 2002 earlier today , steve cooper left the following voicemail for employees . since some employees do not have access to voicemail , we are providing the following transcript of that message . voicemail transcript - steve cooper february 14 , 2002 hi everybody , this is steve cooper . it is february 14 , so happy valentine ' s day to everybody . i just wanted to bring everybody up to speed on a number of items - i want to make sure that i keep you all in the loop so everyone has a pretty good sense of what ' s going on . first of all , i want to thank a number of you for some very nice voice mails or emails . they ' ve been very supportive and i thank you for that . i do intend to get back to everybody personally - - i ' ve just been busy and jammed up this week , but i do want you to know i really appreciate it . it ' s been a little hectic this week , so i do apologize for the delay in getting back to you . anyway , a couple of things have happened this week and i just want to make sure everybody understands what they are . number one is the result of the special investigative report . we ' re beginning to reshape the senior management team and as a result rick buy and rick causey ' s employment with the company has been terminated . to the extent that there are any additional changes , obviously i ' ll keep you up to speed . we ' re also in the process of shrinking and reconstituting the board . six directors resigned earlier this week and their resignation is effective in 30 days . we ' re initiating a fairly aggressive search for some new directors , which will continue to replace some existing directors and at the end of the day the board will be reconstituted . at the board meeting this week , i reiterated that it ' s my intent in working with all of you to present some restructuring proposals to the creditor ' s committee by the second quarter , and nothing that i see today leads me conclude that we can ' t make that schedule . i continue to believe that there is a very nice re - organizable platform here , so that the company can move forward . there was some bad news with respect to enron stock . as far as i can tell , the claims base here - that is bank debt , bond holder debt and other unsecured creditors debt - is going to overwhelm the reorganized value of whatever platform that we move forward . as a result , it ' s not probable that there will any residual value for existing shareholders . that ' s not good news . it ' s an unfortunate result of this problem , and i wish it was different . but i don ' t want you to be misled and i don ' t want any of you to believe that there is value there , because i don ' t think there will be . in particular i don ' t want you to continue to invest your earnings in enron stock without being aware of , at least in my view , shareholder value at the end of the day . the media sometimes interprets the elimination of existing shareholder value as a sign that this is going to be a liquidation . i don ' t believe that will be the case here . i think we have a tough road to hoe . i think that it is going to require us to rebuild credibility in this company and its management team . none the less , i do believe that we are going to have a reorganization here , and i ' m absolutely committed and dedicated to making that happen . a couple of other things that i want you to be aware of : as soon as the dust settles around the reformation of the management team , we will get out a memo as to who the new management team will be and what their roles , responsibilities are . we are continuing to shape and push forward with the creditors committee a retention and severance program , which i know is important to all of you . as that gets cemented , i will provide you with additional updates . and another thing , i ' ve asked a number of our colleagues to plan in early to mid - march , an employee meeting at one of these local hotels . it will , more likely than not , be in the evening and it can go as late as you want it to go . what i thought we would do is give everybody , in a plain vanilla way , a short presentation as to where we are going and how we intend to get there . then we will have a giant question and answer session , so that if any of you have concerns , issues , problems , or upsets , we can get it all out on the table and figure out collectively the best way to deal with these things . that ' s where we stand as of valentine ' s day . once again , i would like to thank all of those of you who have given me some real nice emails and voicemails for your support . again , i apologize that i haven ' t been able to get back to you as quickly as i would like , but i promise you i will and i hope everybody has a great day . if you have any questions or issues , send me an email , give me a buzz or drop by my office . i would be more than happy to have a chat with you . happy valentine ' s day . thanks again so much and i ' ll give you the next update as soon as practicably possible .;Safe Email

1380;n - ary vs . binary lloyd anderson asks how n-ary ( for n greater than 2 ) comparison could ever be worse than binary . consider the problem of heads and tails when we toss coins . what are the chances of two coins ( standing for two languages obviously ) both coming up the same ( i . e . , both heads or both tails ) when tossed once ? since there are four possible outcomes of the binary toss , namely , hh , ht , tt , and th , and only two where both come up the same , the chances are 50 % . but now consider what happens when we toss three coins ( standing for three languages ) . since a coin only has two sides , in each possible outcome at least two of the coins come up the same . so the chances of 2 out of 3 coming up the same ( which would correspond to saying let two out of three languages agree in something and then they are related ) are 100 % ( which means this is not a valid test for relatedness ) . of course , if we had wanted all 3 out 3 to come up the same , then the situation would be drastically different , but in linguistics n-ary comparison never to my knowledge involves such a requirement . however , the only reason that n-ary comparison does so poorly here is that ( a ) there are only two possible outcomes per language , i . e . , languages come in only two varieties , and ( b ) the number of languages being compared is small ( only three ) . the ( a ) part is the one where real linguistic applications are drastically different from our little coin-tossing game ( since when you look for language relationships , you are looking at hundreds or thousands or maybe even more possibilities , not two , because you are looking at phonological shapes of morphemes mostly , and these allow lots of possibilities , at least thousands ) . so in the real situations that alone insures that n-ary comparison is better than binary . but it is also true that if you increase the number of coins ( languages ) in ( b ) , that also has the same effect . but you still have to be careful : the main concern is that given n languages being compared you must worry about how many out of the n are required to agree and about not making that number too small ( if you do , then again chance tends to take over ) . which raises a question : is there any published work on comparing languages which explicitly calculates these numbers ( and does it right ) ? alexis mr;Safe Email

1455;global entelligence status just want to give you a couple of updates . the prototype of the market penetration window was shown to jennifer fraser and chris gaskill yesterday . the overall response was very positive . based on this , it will provide a firmer estimate for delivery of phase i by the end of the week . the cost for the d & b data has been reduced by $ 100 k after additional negotiations . pursuant to that , the agreement was signed last week . the requested data was received yesterday . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by mary solmonson / hou / ect on 03 / 21 / 2000 09 : 55 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - mary solmonson 03 / 07 / 2000 05 : 50 pm to : greg whalley / hou / ect @ ect cc : sally beck / hou / ect @ ect subject : global entelligence status just wanted to let you know a few updates : 1 ) we have a full it team now ready to go . we are going to prototype the first window , market penetration . the prototype will give us something with sample data to show various traders to get additional feedback on functionality . hopefully , we will have something in 2 weeks . 2 ) the previous cost estimates still stand until we have more feedback from the prototype . the estimates are $ 1 . 6 m for phase i and $ 1 . 6 m for remaining phases . 3 ) included in the cost estimate is a figure of $ 389 k for the purchase of customer prospect data from dun & bradstreet . the $ 389 k is an o & m expense amount that was not included in the 2000 budget . this amount combined with other amounts ena did budget for or will spend with d & b results in an overall budget impact over the next 12 months of $ 278 k . i spoke with george wasaff in strategic sourcing this morning at the request of philippe bibi . george has some ideas for negotiating a better deal from d & b . either he will get more customer records for the price or negotiate better terms for a longer term on the recurring contract with d & b . this could take some time and push us late on getting the data scrubbed and ready to go for implementation . i believe i can give george some time to try something , but when it comes down to it , $ 389 k isn ' t that much money . therefore , i suggest that if we don ' t have anything negotiated in the next three weeks , we sign the current proposal from d & b and move forward . d & b is currently threatening ( a negotiation tactic , i think ) to pull their development resources off of this project until they receive a signed agreement . in the event this comes to pass and adversely impacts our delivery of global entelligence , we can provide a letter of intent to keep them moving or sign the proposal at that time . give me a call at 3 - 6079 if you have any comments on any of the above items .;Safe Email

1458;loretta pricing john and louise - based on your meeting with kevin and dave earlier today , i understand you would like a breakdown of the expenditures expected to develop a texas coal plant to the point that it can be monetized . the below is my best estimate for developing the brownsville site to get to the monetization point ( permits in hand and epc contract signed ) . i expect to have both an epc contract and permits in hand some time around sep ' 02 if we start with the expenditures in mid july ' 01 . expenditures will be incurred at the rate of approximately $ 350 , 000 per month for the next 12 months . we can back out at any time with only prompt month plus one additional month committed . costs for a florida site will be similar , however , expenditures will not start until we achieve site control . my recommendation is to start fully developing the brownsville , tx site with a plan to flip the site once we have a permit , as market conditions warrant . i recommend holding off on significant expenditures in florida until we get more comfortable with site control . mitch by 9 / 02 $ 000 ' s option for land lease $ 33 epc contractor preliminary engineering $ 300 owner ' s engineer $ 1 , 200 permit filing - consultant , etc $ 800 detailed engineering $ 1 , 400 fuel transport study / contract $ 200 geotech studies $ 400 total $ 4 , 333;Safe Email

( of these five , probably the best-known is inuit , spoken in a series of well-differentiated dialects ranging from northern alaska , all across the canadian far north , and up to the coast of greenland . while the term inuit is preferred to eskimo by many in canada , the term is retained here because ( a ) it properly refers to any eskimo group , not only the inuit , and ( b ) its use is widespread in native communities in alaska . ) this is a list of lexemes rather than of words . roughly , a lexeme can be thought of as an independent vocabulary item or dictionary entry . it 's different from a word since a lexeme can give rise to more than one distinctly inflected word . thus english has a single lexeme _ speak _ which gives rise to inflected forms like _ speaks _ , _ spoke _ , and _ spoken _ . it 's especially important to count lexemes rather than words when talking about eskimo languages . that 's because they are inflectionally so complicated that each single noun lexeme may have about 280 distinct inflected forms , while each verb lexeme may have over 1000 ! obviously , that would put the number of snow words through the roof very quickly . the list is organized according to lexeme * meanings * . perhaps somewhat arbitrarily i have counted fifteen of them , placing within each of them noun and / or verb lexemes having the same basic sense . and perhaps even more arbitrarily , i ' ve grouped these fifteen meanings into four larger sets . but the most arbitrary decision of all is left to the discretion of the reader-the decision of how to count the lexemes themselves . here are some of the problems you face : ( a ) are all fifteen lexeme meanings really 's now ' - meanings ? that is , do words with these meanings really count for you as words for snow ? [ 2 ] ( b ) there are some synonyms present - - alternative lexemes with the same meaning , like garbage vs . trash in english . are you going to count them separately , or together ? ( c ) if you decided to count synonyms together , will you also count together both of the members of noun-verb pairs having basically the same meaning ? ( the members are , technically speaking , separate lexemes since partly idiosyncratic morphological changes mark the verbal forms , and must therefore be listed separately in any truly informative dictionary , as indeed jacobson 's dictionary does . ) ( d ) following jacobson , i ' ve specially labelled those lexemes that only occur in a small subpart of the central alaskan yupik - speaking region . are you going to try to make counts for each separate dialect ? if yes , you will wonder if you really have enough information to do so . ( you ' re not alone in this-such information is difficult to compile , whether or not you are a linguist , and also whether or not you are a native speaker of a language . ) [ 3 ] a . snow particles ( 1 ) snowflake qanuk 's nowflake ' qanir - ' to snow ' qanunge - ' to snow ' [ nun ] qanugglir - ' to snow ' [ nun ] ( 2 ) frost kaneq ' frost ' kaner - ' be frosty / frost sth .

> > Of course, it would require a minimum of EUR300,000 in funding
>
> It would?Well, yes, if I were to add all the frilly pink bits and the crunchy
chocolate flavoured pieces... :)Seriously, I can only see two reasons to start another distro: you have
something fundamentally different to offer, or you are customising an
existing distro for an unusual and specific situation. Between
Mandrake/YellowDog, RedHat/SuSe and Debian you have enough options to cover
most day-to-day requirements. And a lot of the specific situations are
already covered (smoothwall, familiar, etc.)Therefore, if I were to create a new Linux distribution, I would have to
spend time crafting it so that it offers a lot more than existing
alternatives. My requirements normally involve better support/easier
maintenance, and if one follows the logic through, this would require a
company to be behind such an initiative.I imagine it would be possible to create a new distribution in about one
week[1]. For example: take Debian as your base, slap a specific set of
packages on CD, change a few config files, mention that it has been untested
on most hardware variations, and voila, a new distie. :)- Matthew[1] That is, IT weeks. 1 IT week ~= two months. :)

1479;Okay, I'll ammend that to LIVE OLD tree saving, like the thousands of 
acres of virgin pine forest that was razed here in MS so that our military 
can practice desert warfare?  Fought it for years, lost, now there is a 
stand of trees up and down Hwy 49 that's supposed to try to hide the fact 
that a huge portion of the Desoto Ntl. Forest is gone.

But no.
Previously (v1.0.6 of GnuPG) there would be a slight pause at this point while
it went out to get the public key from a keyserver.
Now, whether I have the key or NOT, I get the failure message.Its as if it cant find gpg to execute it (but I fixed that path), so there
must be something else that I am missing...

>By David Friedman 08/08/2002David is a very bright fellow. But this time he's
several years behind. The idea of using epostage
to stop spam has been discussed quite a bit. The
problem is how to get over the adoption hump.
Until most people are taking one form of epostage,
most people don't have enough incentive to download
and install something that allows them to pay it.
Until most people are set up to pay it, any form of
epostage I require closes my mailbox to unknown
senders from whom I want to receive mail. And even
from known senders. Giving someone my email address
doesn't automatically put them in my white list.Hashcash tries to lower the adoption barrier by
removing the need to pay money for epostage.
Instead, the sender burns processing time on his
computer, answering a cryptographically hard
challenge. But even this requires set-up. There is
inadequate incentive to do so until there is a
standard mechanism, but no standard mechanism is
born until a significant fraction of the market
has taken that first step. It may take government
action, to institute an effective epostage
standard!I think the better idea is to require that people
off your white list hand sign email to you. A
couple of companies are now trying to implement
this. An email sender, if not on your white list,
must respond to a verification email or go to a
website, by a process that is very simply for a
human sender, but difficult for a spammer to
automate. Where epostage requires a standard
mechanism, a variety of mechanisms for hand
signing would frustrate spammers while making it
no more difficult for legitimate senders. I'm
hoping Eudora and some of the other big mail
clients incorporate this kind of feature. The
advantage to putting this in the mail client is
that the required hand sign can be personalized:  Your attempt to email David Friedman is
  blocked until you fill in the blank: The
  Incredible ______ Machine.It will be a long time before spammers have a
process that defeats millions of personal
challenges. On the other hand, I have a hack in
mind that would work a large percentage of the
time. But I'm not telling. If spammers did figure
out such hacks, people would then improve their
challenges. Yeah, this would lead to another
arms race, and spam would leak through to the
unwitting. But this arms race is one that helps
spammers identify and target the part of the
population whose challenges are sub-par, which
is their natural prey. People like David aren't
in the market for herbal Viagra or back alley
debt consolidation.Since David is an anarchist, I'm surprised he
didn't point out that spam is the result of
government. The government is ineffective at
preventing spam, but it DOES prevent individuals
and ISPs from taking retribution against spammers.

1498;Evening Standard - 28 August 2002[Deft use of Fortean Unit of Measurement in 2nd para - MA] 'Lost' penguins found alive
 
 by Charles Miranda A colony of emperor penguins which was thought to have starved to death in
 Antarctica has been found alive in a big huddle.  The birds were spotted by the crew of a USAF jet returning to base in New
 Zealand. Researchers had feared that a breakaway iceberg the size of Jamaica
 had all but wiped out the colony at Cape Crozier on Ross Island. 
 
 Thousands of chicks are believed to have died as an increase in sea ice made
 it impossible for the adults to find food. A detailed count is planned in
 October. Antarctica (New Zealand) chief executive Lou Sanson said: The
 penguins were in a big huddle. We can now hope that the emperors have had a
 successful breeding season over the winter. 
 
 Some 1,000 pairs of emperors - the largest penguins in the world at 3.3ft tall
 and 88lb - usually nest at Cape Crozier, 50 miles from the US McMurdo research
 station. The 200,000-strong Adelie penguin colony, which also nests at the
 cape, may have lost up to third of its population.

business-critical servers. 
Download & test-drive OpalisRobot today! Being that I have a print subscription to PocketPC Magazine, 
I haven't been by their website in quite some time, so when 
Hal Goldstein informed me of a new electronic delivery 
method that they've employed, I felt obligated to give it a 
spin. You can check out the September 2002 Issue of the Digital 
Edition and see if you like reading the mag in that 
format better than the print variety. A Software and 
Accessories Encyclopedia is also new to the site since my 
last belated visit.I've also been using my PocketPC quite a bit lately, but 
not for data. It's found a more frequent home on my belt as 
an MP3 player ever since Diana's dad gave us a bicycle. 
Going out for a morning ride has been quite pleasurable, and 
it's nice to bring along some tunes. I've tried both the 
Compaq iPaq 3870 and HP Jornada 565, and have been more 
pleased with the audio ability of the iPaq, due in part to 
the sound utility Compaq provides to adjust treble and bass 
levels. It's just a more full-sounding device, in my 
opinion. See You in August,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Randy NielandÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â GnomeNETWORK
LDAP Whodunit
Pondered by Warren DugasRandy, a little question for you: Do you know what LDAP is and how important it is to the world of technology? I'm sure you do - but where did it come from? Hmm, let's put our thinking caps on and try to figure it out. Did Microsoft create it? Hmm - No, how about Novell? Nope. Well, who then?History of LDAP http://www.microsoft.com/TechNet/prodtechnol/winntas/evaluate/featfunc/ldapcmr.asp
X.500, the OSI directory standard, defines a 
comprehensive Directory Service, including an information 
model, namespace, functional model, and authentication 
framework. X.500 also defines the Directory Access Protocol 
(DAP) used by clients to access the directory. DAP is a full 
OSI protocol that contains extensive functionality, much of 
which is not used by most applications. DAP is significantly more complicated than the more 
prevalent TCP/IP stack implementations and requires more 
code and computing horsepower to run. The size and 
complexity of DAP makes it difficult to run on thin clients, 
such as the PC and Macintosh where TCP/IP functionality 
often comes with the machine. DAP stack implementations are 
cumbersome to administer, thus limiting the acceptance of 
X.500. Hence in 1993, the folks at University of Michigan, 
with help from the ISODE Consortium, designed and developed 
a protocol that would work over TCP/IP and was small enough 
when implemented to run on a thin client like PC's running 
the Windowsï¿½ operating system or the Macintosh. The LDAP version 1 Specification was published in March 
of 1994. The LDAP version 2 Specification was published as 
rfc 1777 by the Access Searching and Indexing of Directories 
(ASID) working group in the IETF in March of 1995. In April 
of 1996, 40 companies including Microsoft, Netscape, and 
Novell separately announced support for LDAP protocol in 
their Directory Services products in order that they may in 
turn operate with each other and integrate with the 
Internet. LDAP version 3.0 has gone through several drafts 
but at this time is not finished.

Looking for Sound
Suggested by Corey Holletthttp://www.turtlebeach.com/site/products/santacruz/whatdoineed.asp
http://www.3dsoundsurge.com/reviews/earlyimpressions/ProMedia51.html
I've just gone on an extensive hunt for the best 
sound card and speaker set combination for 5.1 sound. My 
criteria were that it be excellent for games, music, and dvd 
playback. A price under $500.00 was also a strong 
point.
Corey came to the same conclusion that others have in two 
respects. Creative has long maintained a healthy share of 
the sound card market with a solid name and decent products. 
Audiophiles know of other brands as well, such as Turtle 
Beach and Philips, which also produce quality sound cards 
and at attractive price points. Corey decided on the Turtle 
Beach Santa Cruz card, a great choice. His choice of speaker systems reinforced my own feelings 
on the subject. I own two Klipsch speaker sets, the ProMedia 
2.400 and most recently the ProMedia 5.1. The 2.400 system 
was the subject of many positive reviews, and believe me 
when I say that the ProMedia 5.1 leaves the 2.400 in the 
dust. The above review that Corey pointed out hits the high 
points, and is actually quite in-depth for an initial 
review. I'm itching to see if they eventually do write up a 
more complete version, as mentioned in the article.

QuickTime 6 Released
http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/
With the debut of QuickTime 6, we can assume that the 
licensing haggles over MPEG-4 have been resolved, making way 
for the long-awaited release. MPEG-4 isn't the only 
addition, joining a new AAC audio codec that is a favorite 
among professionals. Streaming media skip protection, Flash 
5 support and better AppleScript functionality also tag 
along. As always, there is a standard free version available 
for download, but the Pro edition adds additional features, 
such as full screen video playback, the ability to create 
MPEG-4 content and editing features not present in the free 
player.

Microtel & WalMart Love Linux
http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/26192.html
WalMart is selling Microtel PCs, but with a slight twist. 
They were one of the first manufacturers to preinstall 
LindowsOS and offer systems to the retail market through 
WalMart.com, and now Mandrake is being offered as a pre-
installed choice in operating systems. These options give 
potential Linux users an easier way to get started without 
having to build their own system from scratch or deal with 
driver issues, while still maintaining a low overall cost. A 
Pentium 4 2GHz system with a CD-RW drive goes for as little 
as $648 with Mandrake Linux, so not too shabby at all.

I thought I baked my Dell PowerEdge 1400SC server yesterday 
when it refused to boot completely. I borrowed a data vac 
from a friend and decided to clean all of the dust and cat 
hair from my systems, then after reconnecting everything, 
the server would boot to the initial splash screen, where 
there is a POST progress bar, but would not proceed past 
past about the first 1/5th of the bar. Uh-oh. What did I 
fry?As it turns out, it was another case of always check the 
small stuff. Oh, I had all of the cables plugged back in to 
the server properly, I checked all of that, but it didn't 
dawn on me until about a half dozen boot attempts later that 
I should probably turn an eye toward the other end of the 
cables. That server is connected to an 8-port Compaq KVM 
switch and with all of the yanking, plucking and shuffling, 
the keyboard cable had been eeked out of the switch just a 
tad. Why the server didn't display a keyboard warning 
message like every other computer on the planet, I can only 
attribute to the BIOS developers. Server Satchel, running

Windows XP Security Checklist
Finely crafted by Bernie Klinderhttp://www.labmice.net/articles/winxpsecuritychecklist.htm
With all of the security features crammed into Windows XP, 
where does one start? Do you need VPN capability? Is NTFS an 
appropriate file system choice for you? Is there any value 
at all in Simple File Sharing? After much hounding, Bernie 
Klinder has drawn up a healthy checklist of things you need 
to address under Windows XP in order to maintain a system 
that is both security and compatible with the rest of your 
computing world.

ATI Still Makes Video Cards?
http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.html?i=1656
Say it isn't so! Yes, apparently they do still have 
something to say about NVIDIA's dominance in the video card 
market. Seeing as how they've been all but dumped by the 
majority of top-tier system makers, it's hard to believe 
that they are capable of a serious comeback. Judging from 
what AnandTech has to say about the forthcoming R300-based 
cards, it appears that they haven't thrown in the towel just 
yet. I'm all for competition, so I welcome the effective re-
entrance into the high end market. Let's all hope that their 
driver development has improved as much as their hardware 
seems to have.

Technical Censorship
http://news.com.com/2100-1023-944315.html
Odd. I liked that cup of Mocha (spelled M-O-C-H-A and I'll explain in a minute) I drank at Starbucks when Jake and I visited last week, but if I wanted to relay that to someone using a Yahoo email account, you might see an alternate word. Thus the additional hyphenated spelling just in case those of you using Yahoo to subscribe to Lockergnome actually received your issues and the word has been altered to suit their personal opinion of my choice in drinks. They've also had a terrible time interpretting our W3C standardized HTML lately, dropping in copious #message references throughout the text in their new Beta email client. So why the text replacement? It's another filtering technique to stop certain words that might relate to JavaScript functions. I guess I'll have to choose another beverage next time. Silly me.Â GnomeSTUFF
Yer Kidding... Really?
http://www.theregus.com/content/4/25629.html
I'm all sorts of sarcastic today, aren't I? Those of us 
that have had to manage budgets are used to dealing with 
math in terms of hardware, software, maintenance and 
personnel costs. It's not really that difficult. It's 
certainly not hard to see that dropping a free version of 
Linux on a server with less hardware requirements just to do 
some file sharing, printing and maybe an Intranet page or 
three is far cheaper than using Windows. At very long last, 
Microsoft has admitted as much. Of course, they're quick to 
point out that they have much more to offer than Linux, 
which may indeed be true. But at the end of the day, when 
you compare donuts to donuts and like functions against one 
another, Linux is cheaper. For a shop of Windows-trained 
staff, dealing with Linux will certainly be a challenge, 
requiring additional training, suffer the odd blunder here 
and there, and be less forgiving when it comes to detailed 
configuration. On the same token, make a Linux whiz use 
Windows and see how quickly you'll be searching for a 
replacement. Cheap is in the budget of the beholder.

1531;california update 5 / 4 / 01 if you have any questions , please contact kristin walsh at ( 713 ) 853 - 9510 . bridge loan financing bills may not meet their may 8 th deadline due to lack of support sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuance / bridge loan by the may 8 th deadline . any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart . according to sources , both the republicans and democratic caucuses are turning against davis . the democratic caucus is reportedly  unwilling to fight  for davis . many legislative republicans and democrats reportedly do not trust davis and express concern that , once the bonds are issued to replenish the general fund , davis would  double dip  into the fund . clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor . however , it is believed once davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated , a bond issuance will take place . additionally , some generator sources have reported that some of the long - term power contracts ( as opposed to those still in development ) require that the bond issuance happen by july 1 , 2001 . if not , the state may be in breach of contract . sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by may 8 th , having a bond issuance by july lst will be very difficult . the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would  eat  the $ 5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the general fund , thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $ 8 billion . however , the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession . sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor ' s plan for handling the crisis , including the details and terms of all long - term contracts he has negotiated , before they will support the bond issuance to go forward . currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan , ab 8 x and ab 31 x . ab 8 x authorizes the dwr to sell up to $ 10 billion in bonds . this bill passed the senate in march , but has stalled in the assembly due to a lack of republican support . ab 31 x deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts . however , sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen , currently in ab 8 x . senator bowen ' s language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments ( which , if passed , would be likely to cause a socal bankruptcy ) . according to sources close to the republicans in the legislature , republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the general fund . for instance , tony strickland has stated that only 1 / 2 of the bonds ( or approximately $ 5 billion ) should be issued . other republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds . the republicans intend to bring this up in debate on monday . additionally , lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that lehman may back out of the bridge loan . key points of the bridge financing initial loan amount : $ 4 . 125 b lenders : jp morgan $ 2 . 5 b lehman brothers $ 1 . 0 b bear stearns $ 625 m tax exempt portion : of the $ 4 . 125 b , $ 1 . 6 b is expected to be tax - exempt projected interest rate : taxable rate 5 . 77 % tax - exempt rate 4 . 77 % current projected blended ir : 5 . 38 % maturity date : august 29 , 2001 for more details please contact me at ( 713 ) 853 - 9510 bill sb 6 x passed the senate yesterday , but little can be done at this time the senate passed sb 6 x yesterday , which authorizes $ 5 billion to create the california consumer power and conservation authority . the $ 5 billion authorized under sb 6 x is not the same as the $ 5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased , or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward . again , the republicans are not in support of these authorizations . without the details of the long - term power contracts the governor has negotiated , the republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support . no further action can be taken regarding the implementation of sb 6 x until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power . also , there is no staff , defined purpose , etc . for the california public power and conservation authority . however , this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates , who began promoting this idea earlier in the crisis . socal edison and bankruptcy at this point , two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy . the first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the governor . the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is august 15 th , however , some decision will likely be made earlier . according to sources , the state has yet to sign the mou with socal , though socal has signed it . the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis and the senate lack the votes needed to pass . if the legislature indicates that it will not pas the mou , socal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy ( or its creditor - involuntary ) due to the lack operating cash . the second likely triggering event , which is linked directly to the bond issuance , would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb 31 x ( bridge loan ) stating that the dwr would received 100 % of its payments from ratepayers , then the utilities would receive the residual amount . in other words , the state will get paid before the utilities . if this language is included and passed by the legislature , it appears likely that socal will likely file for bankruptcy . socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the dwr proportionately from rate payments .;Safe Email

1553;Hello Gary,
Uh, plague is not action.  No, no one has a problem quarantining
someone who has say, Ebola, or malaria, because diseases do not
require any decisive action -- just contact.fantasies, still require decisive action, even if its in conjunction
with the way the fantasy works in the individual's brain. Many people
have very strange and obscure fantasies (say wanting to be a model)
that dont' require them to be locked up.Fantasies aren't nearly as much like plagues.   Not everyone in a
given population necessarily adheres to that given fantasy, whereas
everyone can get a given plague.   (BTW, gary, the whole concept of
monitoring a given 'racial populaiton' for fear of them getting a
plague is silly.  I don't think plagues discriminate)You're trying to argue for a lock'em all up mentality, when I don't
think anyone but you has even mentioned it.   His point was that
fantaesies were a psychological? explanation for a possible event.
Not that all people who have them, or even have a certain type, need
to be locked up, quarantined, killed, rubbed-out or cleansed.GLM> Well, for example ..>>>>>> b == bitbitch   writes:GLM>     b> Once we understand this [ the fantasy virus model ], many of

were found to be stuffed with incontinence pads and bandages.Trading standards officers, working for Greenwich Council, were alerted to 
the situation after a Bryan punch bag, purchased in Argos, in Charlton Road, 
Charlton, was found to be full of bandages.Also stuffed inside the piece of sporting equipment was a letter from a 
woman in Fife stating how she felt quite disgusted' about the bag and asking 
for the filling to be tested.The unfortunate shopper had bought his first bag, at Argos, in Lewisham High 
Street, but had returned it because on investigation of a leak he was 
horrified to discover it was filled with incontinence pads.So far, officers have purchased two of the punch bags, only to find they 
contain incontinence pads and strips of shredded duvet.Cabinet member for public services Councillor Angela Cornforth said: This 
is one of the strangest stories I have every heard.Our officers are in the process of investigating and will no doubt discover 
why the bags contain such unusual contents.12:18 Tuesday 8th October 2002

um.. http://wwws.sun.com/software/star/gnome/ integrated into solaris.Of course then there's http://wwws.sun.com/software/solaris/freeware/ for

Out of curiosity, does `normal fashion` mean that you still have to do the 
interactive customisations or is it like Solaris jumpstart where you can 
specify everything on the install server, do `boot net - install` go home, and 
come in to a fully installed and patched desktop the next morning?> There are minor problems: like the serial console drivers, but for workstation

I don't see why this should be a _major problem. The prom (ie the ok prompt) 
is almost at the hardware level and hence dosent depend on the os so you 
should be able to connect to that easily enough. Once the machine is installed 
cant you just log in over the network? The network is the computer after all

hmm... I'm not familiar with wyse stuff, but I only need to use the console 
when something breaks, then anything capable of something basic like vt100 at 
9600 8n1 seems to work  . Not sure why you'd need to worry about this much 
really, just set up jumpstart to install automatically then you don't need to 
look at the console at all.Cheers,

1575;http://www.hughes-family.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1054           Summary: Split up FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS
           Product: Spamassassin
           Version: unspecified
          Platform: Other
        OS/Version: other
            Status: NEW
          Severity: enhancement
          Priority: P2
         Component: Rules
        AssignedTo: spamassassin-devel@example.sourceforge.net
        ReportedBy: matt@nightrealms.com
The current FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS triggers on any from where the user name ends
in two or more digits.  I think this should be split up into different
numbers of trailing digits, so that rules with different S/O ratios can
get different scores.  So I've made test rules that look from From
names that end with two, three, four, or five digitis, and one for six or
more digitis, I also put in a test rule that looks for Froms that end in a
single digit, just the sake of completeness.Here is what I got:OVERALL%   SPAM% NONSPAM%     S/O    RANK   SCORE  NAME

because so much of my corpus is made up of Yahoo! Groups traffic, which
seems to have a lot of users that like sticking numbers at the ends of their
names.  Here is the normal stats for FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS:  7.024   28.480    2.834    0.91    0.50    0.88  FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMSand my stats: 19.228   34.793   11.991    0.74    0.35    0.88  FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS------- You are receiving this mail because: -------

1603;sum : ' because ' versus 's ince / as ' ( 6 . 1043 ) i would like to thank the following persons very much for their judgements , comments and various hints concerning my query : marie egan , duncan macgregor , richard ingham , james kirchner , kevin lemoine , david powers , karen ward , yael ziv and especially karen stanley , who took a poll about my claims among her colleagues ( a big thank-you to them too ) . > from the mail i have received by now , the following picture emerges : including the people interviewed by k . stanley , 7 do not agree with my distinction and 5 do agree more or less . some informants suggest other distinctions between the conjunctions : for one , 's ince ' and ' as ' are more formal than ' because ' ( a view which is also presented in some dictionaries and grammars ) , for another , ' as ' is more formal than ' because ' but 's ince ' is  only suitable for informal conversation but nor for writing  . the latter judgement seems to be in conformity with a prescriptivist view according to which 's ince ' as a causal conjunction is not to be used at all . ( i want to note that i have identified 209 ( = 13 % ) causal since-clauses among 1576 causal as - , because - , for - and since-clauses in the machine readable british - english lob - corpus ( written texts from 1961 ) . most of these since-clauses are to be found in the category called ' learned and scientific writing ' . ) another informant , for whom my example sentence ( 1 ) is essentially synonymous with either conjunction , has the impression that the speaker of ( 1 ) using ' because '  feels john 's admission more noteworthy , or more important to the narrative , than he or she would if 's ince ' or ' as ' were used .  into the same direction , i assume , goes another judgement according to which ' because ' is  stronger and more explicit and more exceptional .  ( i have found a similar view in the literature and have interpreted it as a consequence of my differentiation : entailment on the basis of a rule or norm is intrinsically less noteworthy , less exceptional than ' real ' causation . ) some people have pointed out the relevance of the position of the causal clause . as a tendency , my rule / norm interpretation is considered to be more in accordance with the causal clause ( be it 's ince / as ' or ' because ' ) preceding its main / matrix clause . however , one informant feels  more comfortable with since clauses preceding , and because clauses following , the main clause .  ( this impression is somehow in conformity with the statistical situation in the above mentioned lob - corpus : only about 9 % of the because-clauses are preposed , whereas 41 % of the since-clauses and 43 % of the as-clauses are preposed there . ) one informant pointed out constraints which may affect the acceptability of 's ince ' as a causal conjunction :  's ince ' seems to have a much more limited application . for me there is a tense / aspect / ? ? ? constraint between the clauses ( consistent with the temporal meaning it also has ? ? ) , otherwise it sounds forced or stilted . i do n't really like your sentence ( 1 ) with 's ince ' . reversing the clauses makes it more acceptable to me , as does changing ' was ' to ' is ' ( strange ! ) . conversely , changing ' has been ' to ' was ' makes the 's ince ' version even less acceptable to me .  ( probably , the last point in this quotation is caused by the fact that replacement of ' was ' by ' has been ' makes the sentence grammatically acceptable with a temporal interpretation of the since-clause . ) do i have to conclude from the ' empirical ' outcome of my query that my differentiation is not tenable ? for various reasons ( which i hope to develop convincingly in a doctoral dissertation to be submitted soon ) , i do not think so . are there , perhaps , some more people ' out there ' who agree with my claims , but who refrain from simply stating ' i agree ' ? of course , this would not make my query statistically more valid , but it would suggest that there is some plausibility to my non-empirical reasons . carsten breul e-mail : carsten . breul @ rz . ruhr-uni - bochum . de;Safe Email

( otcbb : leth ) current price : 2 . 45 near - term target : 7 . 00 projected high for ' 04 : 15 . 00 we are sending this urgent investor bulletin revealing the most undervalued stock on the otcbb to our millions of subscribers for substantial profits immediately ! sales orders received by leth exceed $ 150 million over the past year while major news was just released that adds multi - millions to the bottom line . leth has experienced a recent spike in price and volume indicating heavy accumulation of shares which is a sign of even bigger things to come for this emerging world leader in the conversion of waste materials into electrical energy , an industry with such high global demand that it is impossible to assign a value to the size of the market . ( mar 9 ' 04 ) urgent news update : leth announces the sale of two ( 2 ) biosphere process systems to procura international limited for $ 14 million with an option for the sale of an additional 98 systems over the next 24 months . solving a dual crisis - waste and energy : leth is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their biosphere process system to generate revenue from the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour which makes a major impact on the global waste problem . this profitable and environmentally safe process converts into clean , green electricity such waste materials as municipal solid waste , agricultural wastes , forestry wastes , medical wastes , industrial wastes , sewage sludge , shale oil , sour natural gas , and the huge market of used tires . leth profits from the sale of electricity created from the waste conversion on a continuous basis by generating 5 to 10 mega - watts per hour of electricity which is then sold to replenish the local or national grid . ( mar 3 ' 04 ) leth release major product delivery and net profit news leth delivered 12 biosphere process systems which resulted in a net profit of $ 3 . 5 million , the equivalent of . 12 cents per share . leth is scheduled to receive an additional $ 7 million translating into an additional . 24 cents per share which is the balance of this completed contract over the next 6 months . the net profit per share from just this single contract would value the stock above $ 6 by calculating the . 36 cents per share total at an average industry pe of 18 - 22 . examining leth - by the numbers total assets : 36 . 8 million = 1 . 26 per share of assets cash : 23 . 4 million = . 80 cents per share of cash shares outstanding : 29 million ( down from 31 . 8 million ) after 2 . 8 million shares retired in feb .

1612;sampson : educating eve g . sampson , ( 1997 ) educating eve : the language instinct debate , cassell , london , 184pp . reviewed by feargal murphy , university college dublin . the rise of generative linguistics in 60s gave a new lease of life to the old nature vs . nurture debate . the behaviourist model of language was judged a failure at explaining the process of language acquisition and a new theory of language acquisition emerged . it was rooted in the philosophy of descartes in the 17th century as well as humboldt and , ultimately , plato . it came to be known as linguistic nativism or rationalist linguistics and is most associated with noam chomsky . the central tenet of this theory is that children are born with some kind of language acquisition device already in place in their brains which allows them to acquire the language of their environment . within linguistic nativism there has been some debate as to whether this device provides merely general rules that allow for the acquisition of language or whether it is a rich innate system that provides a complete basis for language acquisition so that a child can acquire the complexities of a language at a time when its general cognitive development could not possibly cope with such complexity . the rationalist tradition behind linguistic nativism has always been in contrast with empiricism which states that all ideas and knowledge ( including knowledge of language ) come from experience obtained through the senses and that there can be no innate knowledge . a view that goes back to the 17th century and the writings of locke , berkeley and hume and in the modern era has also been associated with the philosophers of the vienna circle and karl popper . _ educating eve _ will certainly not determine the outcome of the nature vs . nurture debate , nor will it , in my opinion , lead to any productive insight into the debate . the book fails to understand the scope and import of the nativist arguments and consequently falls short of presenting a genuine criticism of it . as it stands the book will be applauded by those who are already favourably disposed towards its conclusions and derided by those who are not . _ educating eve _ ( henceforth _ ee _ ) argues against the writings of chomsky , as well as pinker 's ' the language instinct ' , bickerton 's ' language and species ' and jackendoff 's ' patterns in the mind ' . these three books are essentially aimed at the general rather than the specialist reader . the result of targeting these three books is to make the arguments against nativism appear weak and superficial . the desire to rescue public opinion from the wrong path is a recurring theme in the author 's work . in his _ language and liberty _ , which also argued for a non-nativist view of language , the main aim was to discourage people from following left wing politics . the author 's politics , unfortunately , emerge as a strong force in this book . given the importance of the nativism debate i shall focus primarily on the more important linguistic issues , leaving aside politics except when they cloud the issues surrounding nativism the alternative to nativism that this book argues for is essentially a version of karl popper 's empiricism . according to this view the ability to learn may be innate but there are no domain specific innate mechanisms involved in learning . people learn the language of the community they belong to in the same way that they learn anything else , by trial and error . they ' make original though fallible conjectures and test them against objective reality ' ( p . 137 - all quotes are from _ ee _ unless otherwise indicated ) . eventually , using this method , each individual comes to learn a language . what they learn are ' wholly cultural constructs ' ( p . 137 ) , an e - language rather than an i - language , to use chomsky 's terminology . note that the conception of language in _ ee _ is totally different from those of chomsky , jackendoff , bickerton or pinker . for these nativists , language cannot belong to a society rather than to the individual . this issue is not actually addressed in the book . _ ee _ merely states that language is a cultural artifact and not biological , but does not furnish any evidence for this claim . the book also states popper 's belief that the mind is not amenable to scientific theorising ( p . 138 ) . i am unable to find any evidence in the book to support this claim . however , if one assumes that the mind is outside the domain of scientific inquiry then it simply becomes impossible to engage in a debate about the merits of the specifics of any nativist theory . the first task this book undertakes is to demolish chomsky 's arguments for nativism ( only sourcing material up to 1991 ) and then to demolish the 's econd wave ' nativists - with pinker foremost in the second wave . the book utilises many arguments , some more noteworthy than others , and it would be beyond the scope of this review to examine them all . i will look at a few of the arguments , more or less at random . the arguments against chomsky centre on what sampson perceives as the basis of nativism : 1 : speed of acquisition 2 : age - dependence 3 : poverty of data 4 : convergence among grammars 5 : language universals 6 : species - specificity _ ee _ claims the first argument ( speed of acquisition ) is hollow as there is no way of determining what exactly 's peed ' could be in this area . however , it seems uncontroversial enough that children acquire language faster than adults and that they do so without the problems that adults encounter . there is no attempt in the book to address the notion of whether different languages are acquired at different speeds or whether different children acquiring the same language do so in radically different sequences . this would seem to be a distinct possibility if we do not have an innate language specific faculty but rather rely on some generalised learning mechanism . a look at the evidence regarding language acquisition across languages would have helped make the case conclusive . the book should have dealt more with data available in order to show that only a non-nativist account of language acquisition could capture the facts . instead _ ee _ relies on the notion that the popperian account can cope just as well as a nativist account and is closer to the ' common sense ' view of language . but this does not prove that a popperian account is right . chomsky 's second argument ( age - dependence ) is dismissed because , the book states , humans can learn language at any age  if they see the task as worthwhile  ( p . 36 ) . however , the author does not describe any procedure for assessing the worthwhileness of the task . why a child would find it worthwhile to learn a language when its needs are being met by compliant adults responding to non-linguistic communication is not addressed . if the early vocalisations of children are evidence of the beginnings of language acquisition , then the child is deciding at a very early age that language is ' worthwhile ' , at a stage when it seems difficult to believe the child is weighing up any options to see what may or may not be worthwhile . following this logic we could extend the criterion of  worthwhileness  to other ' learning ' such as ' learning to walk ' and eliminate the innate component from that as well . the book states that there are  plenty of cases on record of adults mastering a second language to native-speaker standard apart from accent  ( p . 36 ) , i am not quite sure what it might mean to achieve native-speaker standard apart from accent . what the book suggests - without providing any crucial evidence - - is that  learning as a general process is for biological reasons far more rapid before puberty than after  ( p . 37 ) . this is supposed to show that age dependence is not proof of a critical period for language acquisition using some innate language acquisition device - - a critical period being one of the features that is characteristic of innate behaviour . the age dependence , according to the book , falls out from the slowing down of the learning process in general after puberty . this , however , seems to contradict the other argument against age dependence , that an adult can master a second language to native speaker standard . the author also states that  susan curtiss herself regarded genie as refuting the strong version of lenneberg 's claim , that natural language acquisition cannot occur after puberty  ( p . 37 ) . susan curtiss might want to respond to that one herself . my understanding of her work on genie is that genie did have language ( that is , rule-governed creative linguistic behaviour ) but was not able to achieve anything close to native speaker competence while under observation ( curtiss , p . 204 ) even though it would indeed have been ' worthwhile ' to do so . furthermore her linguistic development did not follow the same course as children acquiring language normally . this suggests that genie 's ability to learn language was diminished due to her age but the important point is that her cognitive development in other areas seemed not to be so affected . it would also have been worthwhile for chelsea to have learned language , yet chelsea did not achieve native speaker standard ( see jackendoff 's _ patterns in the mind _ ) . the third argument presented by chomsky for nativism , according to the book , is poverty of data during acquisition . the arguments against chomsky presented in the book do not bear close scrutiny . according to the book , motherese provides a  graded series of language lessons  ( p . 39 ) and is not at all degenerate , as the poverty of data argument states . this is not particularly new ( the references cited by the author are from the early 70s ) . the fact is , however , that we really do not yet know what role - if any - motherese plays in learning / acquiring a language . but one thing worth noting is that there is no language teaching theory that proposes that adults could be most effectively taught a second language through being taught in motherese . it is also true that there do not yet exist conclusive studies on the universality of motherese ( although the wide variety of language groups studied show a high degree of similarity ) . in some cultures motherese seems to play less of a role and is different to the motherese we see in the english speaking world . in fact motherese or child directed speech seems not to make the task of learning / acquiring language all that much easier but what it does is allow for a high degree of socialisation . this can be seen in the fact that the simplification of structure decreased greatly when the parent and child were no longer in the presence of the observer but merely being taped . the motherese wa s not for the benefit of the child only . of course , if language is not in any way innate we are left with the problem of explaining how child directed speech is so perfectly a  graded series of language lessons  for the infant , despite the fact that adults are not taught how to give language lessons , perhaps empiricist would have to say that the ability to give  a graded series of lessons  in language is innate . the author states that a popperian account of language learning would allow for a child to determine the general principles from the input ( as it would for an adult who wants to learn a language ) . this is important as the nativist account holds that the basic principles of language are innate and thus are available for use in determining what is going on in the language input . individuals learning a language via a popperian method would use their learning abilities to work out the general principles from the input without any of these principles being already available in the head . but what are we to make of cases of * specific language impairment * where the rate of learning / acquisition a language seems different from other areas of learning ? the whole basis of a popperian analysis is that language acquisition is not different from any other domain where learning occurs . consequently , it predicts that there could be no difference between the acquisition of language and learning in other cognitive domains . this prediction runs counter to reported facts as clearly presented in yamada 's 1990 book ' laura : a case study for the modularity of language ' . in arguing against chomsky , the author takes chomsky 's much used example of english speaking children determining how to ask yes / no questions . he is seeking to show that chomsky is being dishonest in his analysis by not verifying the data . a child working out how to make a yes / no question in english has to work out that if any verb is to be moved it has to be the verb in the main clause and not just the first verb encountered in the sentence . to work this out , a child has to distinguish between verbs and other words and also between main verbs and auxiliary verbs as well as knowing the structure of the phrases in the sentence . then the child has to work out that auxiliary verbs in the main clause can move to the beginning of the sentence but that main verbs appear in the infinitive while a tensed 'd o ' occurs at the beginning of the sentence . chomsky 's point is that children learn to make these distinctions and move the appropriate verb from the appropriate position to form a yes / no question with great ease . both the author and chomsky agree on the analysis of the rule involved in forming a yes / no question but where they differ is in their belief about the * exposure * of children to yes / no questions where the main clause is not the first clause in the sentence but rather a subordinate clause appears first , as in : is the man who is talking to bill wearing gloves ? chomsky 's claim is that a child may not encounter such a question in the language s / he hears before determining the rule of yes / no question formation . _ ee _ argues that such sentences are indeed present in the language that children hear . what the book actually has to prove is that all children hear this crucial form of yes / no question before they determine the yes / no question formation rule . this is not shown but instead it is argued that such structures are available to children who read , but children who do n't read learn language as well . indeed it is quite possible that children form the rule about yes / no question formation before the ever learn to read . the author claims that he shows that chomsky is ' wildly mistaken ' ( p . 42 ) , he paraphrases the situation as follows :  . . the man who is the world 's leading living intellectual , according the cambridge university a second plato is basing his radical reassessment of human nature largely on the claim that a certain thing never happens , he tells us that it strains his credulity to think that it might happen , but he has never looked , and people who have looked find that it happens a lot .  ( p . 42-43 ) the people who have looked are sampson himself and geoff pullum ( p . 42 ) but they have only checked sources of written language but as i have said this ignores the fact that illiterate children can also speak . in fact , so enamoured is the author with the written word that he argues that , historically , hypotaxis emerges as literacy develops . somehow the organisation involved in writing leads to great leaps forward in language . he does finally admit that there is no great research on this topic but blames linguistics departments for this (  this is not a popular topic of research in linguistics departments  , p . 75 ) . there is nothing to prevent the taping of the speakers of modern pre-literate languages - if one can find any cultures that could be classed as pre-literate without any qualifications - in order to test for the occurrence of hypotaxis but the author does n't seem to have u ndertaken this task . the book does n't opt fully for the idea that there was little or no hypotaxis in the languages of ancient pre-literate cultures as the author states , hedging his bets :  if there was little or no hypotaxis in these languages  [ the hebrew of the old testament etc . ]  that is a real difference between them and more recent languages  . ( p . 75 ) for obvious reasons we can never answer the question of whether or not there was hypotaxis in hebrew before writing or indeed while writing was still a fairly recent innovation . it is true that serious investigation into parataxis and subordination in various languages has been carried out and goes back over one hundred years . the book claims that  it was a cliche of late nineteenth century linguistics that the early stages of languages with a long recorded history showed a development from what was called parataxis to hypotaxis  ( p . 74 ) . it cites great linguists like karl brugmann , hermann paul and eduard hermann as support for the notion that languages go from a paratactic stage to a hypotactic stage . but there are two problems with this . firstly , not all nineteenth century linguists would have been happy with the notion that hypotaxis emerged as writing developed . hermann jacobi 's 1897 work ' composition und nebensatz ' concluded that  maori , like early stages of pie may not have had contained a relative particle  in subordination ( lehmann , p . 60 ) . so jacobi is claiming that pie did have subordination which is the basis of hypotaxis for brugmann , paul and hermann . secondly , there is really no reason to believe that nineteenth century linguists got everything right in comparative and historical linguistics . the idea that hypotaxis emerged from a previous stage must be seen alongside other ideas in nineteenth century linguistics about the development of languages from primitive systems to more complex systems . the fourth argument the book looks at is convergence among grammars - the notion that people of varying levels of intelligence and exposure to different language inputs , converge on the same grammar . the book claims ( p . 46 ) that chomsky has admitted that educated people may know their mother tongue better . this does not fit in with an i - language approach and so is obviously not representative of chomsky 's theory of language . an i - language approach excludes the possibility of a mother tongue ( an e - language ) that people have mastered to varying degrees . for chomsky such things as english or hungarian or swahili do not exist in any meaningful way . this is controversial , but the point is that for chomsky there is no mother tongue divorced from an individual 's knowledge of it . the second line of argument identified by sampson is that people do not actually converge on the same grammar as they give different grammatical judgments in response to the same data . the book refers to labov 's work - presented in austerlitz ( 1974 ) - where respondents varied in their judgments about the grammaticality of presented sentences . the really interesting thing here is that the people taking the test understood the instructions - oral and written - which they were given concerning the test . it is hard to see how they could all have the same understanding of what was said to them unless they had pretty much the same grammars . the language that was used in their instructions would most likely have contained a variety of syntactic constructions , but there are no reports of the people completing the test remarking on the ungrammaticality of any of the instructions they were given . it is easy to find people varying in groups and even as individuals over time when you ask them to assess sentences such as : ' every one of the boys did n't go there ' . the fact that individuals will differ in their judgment over time shows that what is being tested is not the individual 's competence because an adult 's competence does not vary - although their performance might . a large number of factors determine whether an individual would judge a sentence like the one given above as perfectly grammatical or borderline or totally ungrammatical . but the fact that there is a variation in the reported judgments does not in fact constitute an argument against convergence among grammars it is not a test of grammars but rather a test of performance . intuitions about sentences involving scope relations of quantifiers and negation vary because of the many factors that bear on performance . the book also contends ( pp . 107 - 137 ) that the existence of language universals can be explained by the fact that a popperian learning system will automatically yield such universals . they are not the result of the nature of the language faculty but instead derive from the popperian system of learning . again , the author does not show that a popperian account is better than a nativist account at capturing the facts . if the case against nativism is to be proven , then those language universals that we can agree to exist must be explicable either within a popperian system * only * or at least they should be explained better by a popperian learning theory . the book does not do this . the book targets pinker 's ' the language instinct ' . why sampson decides to devote so much effort to the book is somewhat puzzling . pinker 's book is aimed at a fairly general audience and as such is not really a worthwhile target . among the arguments against pinker we find the assumption that surnames are actual words in individual languages . this means that the existence of a person in england with 's ri ' as the first three letters in his surname means that 's ri ' is a possible initial consonant cluster in english ( p . 83 ) . the author also can't resist taking a pot-shot at what he imagines pinker 's political views to be . the tone of his response to pinker is one of condescension which can be irritating and detracts from any points that the author may be trying to make as well as being irrelevant to the substantive issues . but the worst attack is saved for bickerton . the book seeks to portray him as an intellectual lightweight in a most unappealing way ( p . 76 ) :  [ bickerton 's ] stuff must be a real hit with green students on hawaii  . it is surely not too much to expect that personal abuse would be kept out of the realm of intellectual debate . the book also takes on jackendoff stating that jackendoff writes well :  jackendoff is one of the best writers among the linguistic nativists  ( p . 76 ) , but not forgiving him for being a nativist .  if jackendoff reaches for the word ' instinct ' so hastily in these cases , how can we trust him to use the word judiciously where there are real questions to be resolved  ( p . 79 ) . the main issue picked up on in jackendoff 's work relates to sign language . at one stage the author says ( arguing against jackendoff 's analysis of universal grammar ) :  jackendoff has shortly beforehand pointed out that one aspect of american sign language grammar is not paralleled in any spoken language . the sign-language equivalent of the third person pronouns ( she , they , his ) consists of gesturing ( with hand shapes and movements that depend on whether the reference is singular , plural or possessive ) to locations in the signing space which have been assigned to successive topics of conversations . ' the effect is that there are as many different third-person pronouns available as there are discernible locations in the signing space ' . no spoken language has a pronoun system remotely like this , so how can it be part of our innate knowledge .  ( p . 78 ) the author is missing the point here . sign language expresses person , number , gender and possession as spoken language does and not some other features not found in spoken language . so the system the same as spoken language . the use of pronouns in sign language is exactly the same as the use of pronouns in spoken language and is based on universal grammar , what is different is the modality . the availability of the signing space means that a signer can introduce a greater number of pronouns into the discourse as each pronoun can be allocated a location in the signing space without leading to any confusion . this is the same as the fact that i could use as many second person singular pronouns as i wanted as long as i looked at the individual that i was addressing with that pronoun . looking at the person that i was referring to with the pronoun is really the same as the signer using the sign space to tag pronouns . this is not just true of second person pronouns . i could be talking about , say , the members of a football team and refer to each individual using a third person pronoun . i could be quite clear in my own head who is being picked out each time , it would just be confusing to the person i was talking to . this is because there would be no way for them to distinguish the referents of each of the pronouns . in sign language i can exploit the possibility of the signing space by tagging each meaning of a pronoun with a location in space so that the whole thing does not get confusing . the potential in both oral and sign language is the same , but sign can exploit the signing space in a way that oral language cannot . the point is that the limitations are not imposed by language but by the modality . what jackendoff is saying is that the same universal grammar underlies language no matter what the modality . the last chapter in the book ( ' the creative mind ' ) presents sampson 's view of popper . it is not without problems and the author devotes much time to arguing that popper did n't always mean what he said and that sampson 's analysis of popper is the best . however , the crucial lines in the chapter for the purposes of nature vs . nurture are :  minds are not a topic open to scientific theorising .  ( p . 139 ) and  the position adopted in this book is that conscious human minds are not physical entities . talking about minds is not a way of talking about high-level aspects of brain functioning . minds and bodies are different and separate things which act on one another .  ( p . 138 ) for all those people who believe that minds are indeed a topic open to scientific theorising this will render anything else the book has to say suspect . modern nativists ( as well as most non-nativists ) view the mind as amenable to scientific theorising . for chomsky there is no other possible way to study the mind ( chomsky 1993 , 1995 ) . it is hard to see how a significant debate can take place between two such opposite points of view . the author is committed to the cause of a popperian analysis of language learning / acquisition but will never be able to convert a nativist to his way of thinking until he can gain an understanding of the motivations for adopting a nativist position or reconcile himself with the possibility that nativism may be a stance that an intelligent person can adopt . the author seems to imagine himself fighting a rear guard action against the hordes of misguided nativists who , as he sees it , are close to winning the hearts and minds of the masses . one important aspect of this book is that it can be read as a means of testing how one feels about linguistic nativism . unfortunately for sampson 's crusade , it had the effect of making me prefer the nativist analysis even more than before .

1615;urgent reply . from the desk of : barr arisman shonikon chambers & associates no 56 b . aba road , port - harcourt nigeria private email address ( @ shymail . com ) dear i sincerely apologize for intruding into your privacy especially by contacting you through this means for a business transaction of this magnitude , but due to its seriousness and urgency it therefore became necessary for me to seek your assistance . i am barr . arisman shonikon , the personal lawyer to late mr . frank ionescu , a foreigner , who worked with an oil servicing company in the oil rich niger delta area of bayelsa state . i am contacting you concerning my late client and an investment he made . i would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail . i contacted you independently and no one should be informed of this communication . i would like to intimate you with certain facts that i believe would be of interest to you . this is a genuine transaction and is 100 % risk free . all i ' m demanding from you is your honest co - operation to enable us achieve our goal , and not a perfidious person . on the 6 th of may , 2002 it was reported to us that my client , his wife and their only daughter were involved in a local plane crash at kano state , enroot abuja ( the capital city ) all occupants in the plane lost their lives , unfortunately on this same flight were other dignitaries like the sports minister and a host of others meanwhile , until his death , my late client had a fixed deposit account of usd $ 15 . million deposited in a security company ( unic security company ) here . recently , i received an ultimatum from the security company asking me to provide my late client ' s relative so that the money would be given to them . but unfortunately it was discovered that my late client did not declare any identifiable family member in all the official documents he tendered to the security company while opening the account . therefore , this development leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit my late client made and who is entitled to be the bona fide beneficiary / next of kin or relative because he died intestate . therefore , if i fail to locate any of his relatives or his next of kin ( and have this money transferred to them ) the security company will at the expiration of the 6 weeks ultimatum given to me confiscate the account . according to the ultimatum issued to me by the security company , if i fail to present to them my late client ' s relative , with a legitimate statement of claim for the money before the given time they will confiscate the account and the money declared ' unclaimed balance ' . this will result in the money being taken over by the security company . this will not happen if i have my way . since i have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives of my late client all these while , my proposal , therefore , is to present you as the next of kin / relative of my client due to the fact that you are a foreigner and can easily pass as a possible relative of my client . i know you will be wondering how possible this could be but i assure you that this is simple . i therefore seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to my client so that the money he deposited with the security company would be paid to you and there after you and i will share the money 40 % for you and i will be taking 60 % . i assure you that the deposit would be released to you within a few days because i have all the relevant information that would facilitate that will be required on documentation . first , i will like you to provide immediately the following information : your full names . contact address . telephone / fax numbers . with this information i will prepare the necessary documents and affidavit that will put you in place as the next of kin . after we have successfully satisfied the requirements of the bank the money totaling usd 15 . million would be paid into your account for you to take 40 % and i will be taking 60 % . all i require is your honest co - operation to enable us see this through . there is no risk at all because everything would be done legally and my position as a qualified attorney will facilitate everything . secondly , i will give you all the necessary documents that would serve as evidence proving that you are the next of kin / relative of my late client . these documents will legally conferm on you the status to act as the beneficiary of the estate of my late client . what i related to you might smack of unethical practice but i want you to understand that this is a once in life time opportunity capable of turning around our situation . the truth is that this money would not be taken by the government but by some greedy security company officials and i would not fold my arms and watch this happen hence my decision to contact you . if you are interested in doing this transaction with me kindly send your reply to this email address : ( arismanshonikon @ shymail . com ) thank you as i await your positive response . barr . arisman shonikon .;Phishing Email

August 30, 2002 1:01 pm PTMAX LEVCHIN'S FASCINATION with encryption started when he was a teenager 
in Kiev, Ukraine, and continued as he immigrated to the United States 
where he attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In 
late 1998, not two years out of college, he drew on his passion to 
co-found PayPal, the online payment system that has since attracted tens 
of millions of users and gained the reputation as the premier Internet 
transaction processor. Now online auction house eBay has acquired his 
company for a king's ransom.Not bad for a 27-year-old kid from Ukraine.A programmer since he was 10 years old, Levchin and his family moved to 
Chicago in 1991, and since then he has pursued security as if on a 
mission. He created a startup right out of college to build secure 
passwords for Palm Pilots. He met Peter Thiel, and the two founded 
PayPal to target online payment security. Thiel is now CEO of the 
company.This company was founded on the notion of security value, Levchin 
says. Peter Thiel and I shared that vision from the very beginning.Thiel concentrates on company business matters, whereas Levchin remains 
focused on security, which he says is the key to the company's good 
fortune.I explain [PayPal] as a security company posing as a transaction 
processor, Levchin says. We spend a lot of time designing security so 
it doesn't step on the toes of convenience and not the other way around. 
The trade-off is fundamental.Mountain View, Calif.-based PayPal allows businesses and consumers with 
e-mail addresses to send and receive payments via the Internet, 
accepting credit card or bank account payments for purchases. The 
service extends to 38 countries, with more than 17 million users and 
more than 3 million business accounts.Most of PayPal's users are participants in online auctions, which led 
PayPal to be closely linked with eBay, the leading Web auction site. 
Although they were once rivals, the relationship between the two 
companies resulted July 8 in eBay's tentative $1.5 billion acquisition 
of PayPal. The agreement is subject to regulatory review.Levchin says he will stay at PayPal as it merges with eBay. There are 
areas of synergy and collaboration we can explore.Although security is a dominant feature for PayPal, the company's 
ability to carry out open communications among the millions of 
participants fits the growing Web services model, Levchin says.This is a service that links people and allows them to send messages to 
one another, he says. Levchin is a panelist at InfoWorld's 
Next-Generation Web Services II conference Sept. 20PayPal, as an online payment system, is a natural target for fraud. And 
Levchin has almost singlehandedly saved the company from thieves bent on 
exploiting the system, says Avivah Litan, a vice president and analyst 
covering financial services at Stamford, Conn.-based Gartner.If they didn't have Max, they might have succumbed, because PayPal was 
susceptible to fraud and money laundering, and Max tightened them up, 
Litan says.To combat criminals, Levchin established Igor, an antifraud program 
that monitors transactions and warns of suspicious accounts. Levchin 
says building security and antifraud systems is a job he relishes. The 
work I do is important to PayPal and to consumers in general because the 
work makes Internet shopping safe. It's the view that ecommerce has 
arrived.

there are several of us who are in the BDSM lifestyle who are trying to 
encourage our local groups to find alternatives to yahoo groups as a way 
of communicating with each other.  I've set up a place to have maillists

anyone knows of an alternative that allows all the bells and whistles that 
yahoo has, such as reminders, file storage, calendars, etc.  Anyone?

( informally this is being done ) i would have expected the business to utilise a crude ( and possibly necessarily overstated ) scaling factor based on the volatility of credit spread movements in the market and for rac to have signed off this scaling factor . bryan seyfield and david wall will propose this immediately . finally , i believe both commercial and commercial support for credit trading are reprioritising the work being completed for the model for var reporting - we should communicate the new delivery date as soon as possible . i look forward to discussing this and other rac / commercial support interface issues with you next week regards mike from : ted murphy 26 / 06 / 2000 14 : 50 to : sally beck / hou / ect @ ect , mike jordan / lon / ect @ ect , fernley dyson / lon / ect @ ect , bryan seyfried cc : rick buy , richard causey / corp / enron @ enron subject : re : var for credit trading please see the attached comment at the bottom of this string of e - mails . the privilege of using enron ' s balance sheet comes with the responsibility to adequately report the risk in the form that has been agreed to . it is appalling to me that we are currently incapable of calculating var in a product that has been approved for trading for several months . it is equally appalling that the support staff continues to be so unaware of the importance of this that the comments below could even be considered reasonable . obviously , the individual who made the comment is hardly responsible . it lies with both commercial and commercial support management . i know that airing this out in such a broad way appears to be harsh . this is not the point . this is not an isolated problem . it is not just pertaining to europe . please do not feel singled out . but the scrutiny and pressure on var as a measure of risk continues to grow at fast pace . we can hardly make any progress if this is the pervasive attitude . let ' s knock this stuff out one at a time . ted oliver gaylard 06 / 26 / 2000 08 : 34 am to : david port / market risk / corp / enron @ enron cc : chris abel / hou / ect @ ect , michael e moscoso / hou / ect @ ect , david a wall / risk mgmt / lon / ect @ ect , ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect subject : re : var for credit trading the var engine for credit trading is being built by research in london and it is intended that var be run daily as soon as they have produced / signed off on this . oliver from : david port @ enron 26 / 06 / 2000 14 : 24 to : chris abel / hou / ect @ ect cc : michael e moscoso / hou / ect @ ect , david a wall / risk mgmt / lon / ect @ ect , oliver gaylard / lon / ect @ ect , ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect subject : re : var for credit trading my view : prove its insignificant by calculating it every day , that ' s why the board approved the limit . dp chris abel @ ect 06 / 23 / 2000 07 : 41 am to : david port / market risk / corp / enron @ enron cc : michael e moscoso / hou / ect @ ect subject : var for credit trading fyi - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by chris abel / hou / ect on 06 / 23 / 2000 07 : 38 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - mary thambiah 06 / 23 / 2000 03 : 29 am to : chris abel / hou / ect @ ect cc : david a wall / risk mgmt / lon / ect @ ect subject : var for credit trading hi chris i talked with david yesterday and we don ' t think the risk is significant enough to start calculating a var number . however if you have any queries feel free to give him a call . rgds mary;Safe Email

If u choose Setup NT from the installation CD it will reboot your system

Hi,I've installed Quake 3 onto my computer and it starts to run up ok but as
soon as the graphics start it bails out.  It complains that there is an
error in sis_drv.o,  the line before this says that it is starting Quake in
24 bit depth, now from http://www.winischhofer.net/linuxsis630.shtml I
understand that the sis630 won't do 24 bit depth.  So is there a way to make
Quake start up in 16 bit depth?  I've done some googleing but drawn a
blank.....ThanksGreg

    From:        Chris Garrigues 
    Message-ID:  <1030028647.6462.TMDA@deepeddy.vircio.com>   hmmm, I assume you're going to report this to the nmh folks?It turns out, when I did some investigation, that my memory of how MH
worked here was wrong (that's not unusual) - the -seq switch seems to
have always done -nolist (requiring a subsequent -list to turn it on
again).Given that, I have no idea how the pick code as it was ever worked.  In
fact, it quite possibly never did the way it was intended to (I have just
been browsing the 2.5 sources, and that seems to be attempting to do things
that I never saw happen).It may be that your new sequence method just exposed the bug that had been
there all along.Given this, I won't be sending any bug reports to the nmh people.  If nmh
ever seems to be showing any signs further progress, and if I remember this
then, I might send them a change request.   The code to make the change is
trivial.kre_______________________________________________

1710;It was the Spring of 1979.  I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school
with buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the
cafeteria, I walked from table to table ...Stealing other kids' lunch money.No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made
them a little deal.  Let me borrow two dollars today, I said,
and I'll bring you five dollars next week.  The investment
was too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their
lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course 
when next week rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash,
I promised to pay them even more the week after that,
if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit 
longer.Eventually the end of the year came and went, high school
started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,
and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more 
things on their mind than last year's lunch money.I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,
and I didn't even get beat up.Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market 
secrets you will ever learn.First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're not
going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when
you're ahead.  Don't wait for the boat to sink before 
grabbing the lifejacket.Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.
They are looking out for their own money, not yours.The professionals, those stuffy investment counselors and
money managers, will always tell you that the best time to
buy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keep
your money in the market, the more money you're going to make.
Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is
NEVER.  In a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index
fund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars
in thirty or forty years.  But here's the problem:Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?Hell no!You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to
make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old 
in a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in
the next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would
you travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility
is your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to see
those large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed
by the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don't
care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long
it was UNSTABLE.  That's how you're going to make the 
money.What I'm talking about here is day trading.  My father invests the traditional way, he holds some good stocks 
and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years 
he makes money. The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a
$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking 
advantage of all the information at his disposal about a 
certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or 
down within hours, sometimes within minutes.  I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing 
amounts of money at it.  It's not rocket science, and you 
only need to learn a few basic principles to get started.Society would have you believe that successful trading is 
complicated and requires formal training.  The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment 
strategies to make money.  Popular media and investment professionals portray successful
trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing
ring.  They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell
don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm
to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty 
dollars.They make their money only if you believe two lies:1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average 
person.2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high 
commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks 
per trade.Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely,
positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...The strategies for profitable day trading are in fact
so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend
a few hours of studying.  After reading over 200 financial books and publications
during the past decade, and after using day trading
to successfully make more than four million dollars in
the stock market, I've learned the following lessons:** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.** Anyone can do it.** It only takes a few hours to learn.When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't become
wealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. 
Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The 
only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through
hard work, knowledge, and determination.After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started 
practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks
brought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical
experience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling
close to a six figure income. In less than three years with no 
formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,
I had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained 
during those formative trading years I am willing to share
with you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn from
my mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,
secret formula for day trading that I've used profitably
year after year.The income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even 
hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within
minutes.  The difference between making money and losing your 
shirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,
and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. Average Income of a Day Trader: 
5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year
22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year
35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 
27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 
11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year After reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely 
profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give 
you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you 
win DESPITE the current market weakness. Here is just a snippet of what I will teach you:*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.
*** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.
*** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to 
buy them and the exact price to sell them. 
*** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the 
mistakes beginners make.
*** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money 
consistently in every market! 
*** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance 
for great success. 
*** Profit on huge intraday price swings.
*** Make money on the biggest news stories.
*** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum
returns. 
*** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street 
professionals use.
*** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. 
It's time to ask yourself: Am I going to listen to the 
Professionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?  Or am
I going to take control of my own financial future, and
start making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?Who is looking out for your best economic interests - some
wealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself?With the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you 
need to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from 
choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the 
lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional 
trading strategies that make professional traders millions of 
dollars.The Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to 
understand and straight-forward book ever written about active 
trading. If you are serious about success in short term stock 
trading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the road to your
own financial future.Oh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade?
His high school friends laughed when he said he was going to 
make money in the stock market.  Six years later, he bought a beach-front home on the California
coast - WITH CASH.  Oops, they weren't laughing anymore.In a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading
is the fastest track to wealth.  If you're looking
for a long-term retirement investment with no risk 
that goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain't
your kind of game.But if you want the QUICKEST possible way to make a FORTUNE
in the market, with the lowest element of risk, then
order the MASTER TRADER e-book right now.  I promise
to teach you ALL of the secrets that helped me become a
millionaire through successful day trading.You don't need to know anything about the market, and
anyone can do it, with minimum effort.  It's an easy
game to win if you know how the pieces move.Order the MASTER TRADER e-book right now for only $49.97

Web-based services from dynamic composible resources, extending both the
range and scope of services that can be made available through the Web.The goal of this one-day workshop is to bring together members of the Web
design, software engineering, and information technology communities to
discuss techniques for migrating to Web services. Architectural styles and
tool support for service-based Web sites are currently quite diverse.
Expertise in constructing service-based Web pages is quite limited, and
experience accounts are lacking. The explosion of non-traditional computing
platforms for browsing the Web, such as PDAs, WAP-enabled phones, and
Internet appliances, is forcing Web professionals to rethink the separation
of form from content and the range and scope of services offered via the
Web.WSE 2002 will provide an opportunity for the exchange of information related
to exciting new research and empirical results in areas including (but not
limited to):*   Migrating to Web services
*   Web quality determination and improvement through process and product
control
*   Enhancing Web sites to make them more accessible, reliable, and usable
*   Analyzing and reverse-engineering Web site content and structure
*   Making Web site content available in multiple formats for multiple
platforms
*   Applying traditional software engineering activities such as
architecture, metrics, and testing to Web sites
*   Case studies of large-scale Web site reuse, reengineering, and evolutionWSE 2002 is co-located with the IEEE International Conference on Software
Maintenance (ICSM 2002). ICSM is the IEEE Computer Society's flagship event
focused on the modernization of existing systems. ICSM 2002's theme of
maintaining distributed heterogeneous systems nicely compliments WSE
2002's overall theme and goals.http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

The way to debug something like this is to turn on the log (Preferences 
-> Hacking Support -> Debug log enabled) and track the gpg commands 
being issued and the responses.FWIW, using exmh 2.5 and gpg 1.0.7 I do not have problems sending 
encrypted messages to myself. When I select the message, an xterm 
window pops up asking for the passphrase. I don't recall exmh ever 
asking me for the passphrase from the tty that started exmh nor from a 
dialog box. (But then again, I'm not a heavy gpg user).KevinIn message <200209111917.PAA02912@blackcomb.panasas.com>, Brent Welch writes:

spite of the perception that people should not look to the government for
help, the great government give-away programs have remained so incredibly
huge that if each of the approximately 8 million businesses applied for
an equal share, they would each receive over $70,000.
Most
people never apply for FREE Business Grants because they somehow feel it

The Complete Guide to Government
Grants is so comprehensive, it provides you with direct access to practically
every source of FREE government grants money currently available.
If you're an American citizen
or resident, you are entitled to free grant money ranging from $500 to
$250,000 or more. If you are Black you have already qualified for 15 programs,
being Hispanic, you qualify for many programs. Being a Christian will get
you into 20 programs, there are also many other programs available for
different faiths, Jewish, Catholic. Not having any money, will get you
into over 30 programs, 550 programs if you are unemployed, or underemployed.
The list and sources are endless.
You Are Eligible! This money
is Absolutely Free and will be yours to use for any worthwhile purpose.
Did you know you can apply
for as many grants as you want?
It's true, For instance,
you could get a $65,000 grant to begin a weight loss business, get $8,800
in tuition to become a nurse or $35,000 to open up the day-care center,
you've always dreamed of owning. And then, go out and apply for a grant
to buy a home for you and your family. And once your new business starts
doing well you could go out and get another grant for expansion of your
business. The possibilities are endless.

Next major release is scheduled to contain: - Core: hard coded root public key, for authenticating top level NameSpaces - Signing Services: Implementation of web based signing services End user hosted signing service - Example User Authentication Application - Example Payment System based on NeuDistI will be expanding the documentation over the next few weeks. This will cover not only more indepth technical documentation, but also higher level documentation about the business side of things.Read more about NeuDist or download our early version at http://neudist.org I would love to hear your questions and suggestions.

1746;Well, for one, it would free up the similar laptop I already got to
just run Amithlon (or if that wasn't so fun, bsd) to run just OpenBSD!This is a near-term thing I could look forward to!However, an 'official' laptop seems unexciting to me with only
the items mentioned.  Most important are the particulars distinguishing
the listed spec from a Dell 2650, preferably:
1- GeForce4 440 Go or newer, pleasingly modern GPU, the
   GeForce2Go (with 16MB video RAM, too little) I have is
   not so much too slow as inefficient, with factory settings it would
   actually crash from running too hot and too fast.
   (Accelerating the Ami* and possibly OpenUAE graphics
   is a necessity to meet for good speed in those environments,
   but an energy-efficient GPU is a good sideeffect and
    portability (read: battery lifetime) enabler.)1.5- Great control over CPU state, by use of 'internet keys'
    wired to BIOS/bhipset routines directly or preferably a scroll
    wheel.  Also, hibernate that works, please.1.7- Bootable to USB 2.0 drives (e.g. larger external ones)
    in BIOS, please.2- P4 Dells overheat.  They have a big heatsink and a little fan
   to pull air through it, and if you don't elevate thelaptop off
   the desk or table or bed it's on, the fan will -stay- on.  Not good
  for MTBS (mean time between service, unless you've got an
  angle on making money on service from Amigans.....)
     One excellent solution is to include a heatpipe which runs
  behind the AMLCD, thus using the backside of the display
  half as a radiator., though it interferes with the case notion
  below.  (yes, Aavid or such makes some as a standard part.)
      I prefer to include the heatpipe but employ the radiative
  mass in elevating the laptop (i.e. in the form of a catch-handle
  and second logo device behind the laptop, which generally
  provides stow and attachment for elevation legs (move them
  out farther to get to the next-higher ekevation, until the sides
  of the laptop are met.)  This also happens to provide a little
  protection for USB 2  and 1394 cables that I tend to keep
  plugged in all the time (a bit longer port life? Please.) 3- A case color other than brown or black, and preferably (if the
    display module NRE is entirely permissive) the capability to
    -run with the backlight off.-  Again, to save battery power, but
    also as a feature, maybe you remember the iBooks modified
   in this manner.  The user has the privilege to pull out the
   backlight diffuser and fiberoptic lightpipe/CF assembly, with
   its backreflector, and the whole warrantee.  This provides
   for excellent outdoor use, often with the diffuser reinserted
   to keep depth-of-field distractions minimised.
     What would I like?  A1200 putty color, any translucency,
   in or over a rosewood-colored (in KDE color browser, I see
   chocolate, firebrick and a couple of 'indian red' that are great
   candidates) base.  
      I would also like to be able to at least turn off the backlight
    without closing the lid, and to be -able- to fit an -external-
    light source such as a UV-filtered solar collector (and glare
    hood) to feed
    into the backlight.  Not only does this make an excellent 
    color environment but lets one work outdoors tolerably.
      The logo should be a coloration of a
   minimal surface, as the MAA is trying to get me to renew
   with:  demos at http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/pbourke/geometry/
   at first blush.  We'll see what comes out of the contest and
   maybe you'll like the mapping MathCAD does of the
   logo to a minimal surface or manifold that reflects the
   openness of AmigaOS, Ami* and Amiga community.
   MAA.org has more references, I'm sure.4- Obviously Elfin details., e,g, the backlight inlet.Other details:
USB2.x preferred, FireWire would be needed if that's unavailable.
Options like 802.11b or attabhable WiFi hub for ethernet port
should round out the offering.  An option for just-released 
.13 micron P4 (with mobile power features) could make more
reviewers greenlight the series, much better power consumption,
and almost certainly a higher a top clock come with that.
CompactFlash, SmartMedia and MMC flash memory card
interfaces would be very pleasant.  I've mentioned booting to
USB, and booting from CF would be a pleasant extigency also.
To that end, a backup solution with compression using
USB 2 storage or the multimode drive is always a nice 
bundle item, that or a chance to back out a patch under 3 OS.....
Blue skies (and clear water and fresh air): 
Waterproof to 30 feet, 3 Ethernet ports plus onboard WiFi.
Svelte, 3-line frontpanel LCD and bright red pager LED,
builtin G4 cellphone functions, choice of side and 
frontpanel trim: Ivory-like stuff inscribed with M68k memory map
and various OS 3.9 structures or textured fur that
says 'This is Amiga Speaking' when stroked 'round. 
Decent keyboard, as in Toshiba or IBM laptops, perhaps 
an ergonomic fingerworks.com device (they work as 
keyboard and mouse) as the keyboard/trackpad.
2 Directional planar mics atop AMLCD, soundcard with multiple 
18 bit A-D and noise reduction DSP that work in our
(second-through-fourth, at least) favorite OS.

1747;*****************BANNEDCD::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::>NET******************I have been receiving emails saying that I'm contributing to the moral decay of society by selling the Banned CD.  That may be, but I feel strongly that you have a right to benefit from 
this hard-to-find information. So I am giving you ONE LAST CHANCE to order the Banned CD! With this powerful CD, you will be able to investigate your friends, enemies and lovers in just minutes using the Internet.  You can track down old flames from college, or you can dig up some dirt on your boss to make sure you get that next promotion! 
  Or maybe you want a fake diploma to hang on your bedroom wall.  You'll find addresses for companies that make these diplomas on the Banned CD. Need to disappear fast and never look back?  No problem! 
Using the Banned CD, you will learn how to build a completely 
new identity. Obviously, the Powers That Be don't want you to have the Banned CD.  They have threatened me with lawsuits, fines, and even imprisonment unless I stop selling it immediately. But I feel that YOU have a Constitutional right to access this type of information, and I can't be intimidated. 
 Uncle Sam and your creditors are horrified that I am still selling this product!  There must be a price on my head! Why are they so upset? Because this CD gives you freedom. 
And you can't buy freedom at your local Walmart.  You will 
have the freedom to avoid creditors, judgments, lawsuits, IRS 
tax collectors, criminal indictments, your greedy ex-wife or 
ex-husband, and MUCH more!Please Click the URL for the Detail! http://%32%317.%31%30%36.%355%2E97

I'm skeptical.  One of the many perversions of modern civilization is the fictitious
rendering of various peoples, frequently to the point where the fiction
is more real than the reality.  You see it over and over again in
history:  The Primitive People pull a fast one on Whitey The Junior
Anthropologist, playing to all the prejudices of Whitey (who only became
Junior Anthropologists to support personal ideologies), and before you
know it the charade takes on a life of its own which the Primitive
People are compelled to perpetuate.  Worse, even when there is
substantial evidence to the contrary with some basic scholarship, the
facts have a hard time competing with the ideologically pleasing fiction
that is already firmly entrenched.  And many peoples (e.g. American
Indians) develop a profit motive for maintaining and promoting the myth
in popular culture.I'm far more inclined to believe that people is people, no matter where
you are on the planet.  The only time you see any anomalies is when you
have a self-selecting sub-population within an otherwise normal
population, which is hardly a fair way to look at any major population.-James Rogers

Date: 2002-10-02T09:42:39-05:00I think I'm going to become one of _those_ people. You know, one of those 
people who has a â€œSemantic Webâ€ category on their weblog. This will 
be a Geek Purity Test question someday. Onward: - _Phil Ringnalda_: Fun with RDF[1]. â€œRDF can actually be fun, as long as 
you don't foolishly invest too much ego in trying to store RSS 1.0, or wander 
off into flame wars.â€ From which we find: 
- _Shelley Powers_: The RDF Query-O-Matic[2], and The RDF Query-O-Matic 
explained[3]. â€œThe Query-o-Matic accepts the name of an RDF file (any 
valid RDF file), and an RDFQL (RDF Query Language) query, and will print out a 
test value found as a result of that query.â€ 
- _Marcus Campbell_: â€œMy FOAF autocreation script is moving along nicely
[4]. It's now looping through my OPML blogroll file, checking the first load of 
bites in people's pages for head linked FOAF files, grabbing certain elements 
from these files (if they have one) and spitting them out into a brand new FOAF 
file for me.â€ 
- _Joe Gregorio_: The Well-Formed Web[5]. â€œAfter spending some time 
badgering poor Bill Kearney for a concrete benefit of having RDF in RSS 1.0 and 
not getting a really satisfactory answer I went back and read Paul Ford's essay 
again. I wanted to get that old religious feeling back again. It didn't work. 
The magic was gone.â€ [1] http://philringnalda.com/archives/002336.php

acl ' 98 workshop  the computational treatment of nominals  august 16 , 1998 universite de montreal montreal / canada http : / / www . cs . brandeis . edu / ~ federica / workshops / coling / call . html this workshop aims at bringing together researchers who are interested in the study of the computational properties of nominals and noun phrases . the focus is on representational questions as they relate directly to nlp requirements and applications . understanding the properties of the nominal system is extremely important since nouns and nominalizations are used extensively by both people and systems : searching and communicating with either a telegraphic or a more expressive language involves heavy use of nominal forms . a number of nlp applications , ranging from  intelligent  key-word search to text summarization and information extraction , among others , not only require some way of recognizing nominal forms , but also require at least a shallow understanding of the semantic information that nouns carry . it is therefore of great interest to consider what impact representing semantic knowledge at a finer level of granularity would have towards enhancing a system 's performance . submissions are invited on one or more of the following topics : * representation of nominals : o design of noun ontologies for use in lexical semantics and machine translation o ambiguity , polysemy , vagueness , and underspecification in the semantics of nominals o identifying the minimal requirements for lexical representations * representational issues in the acquisition of knowledge : o from corpora o from mrds o syntactic and morphological bootstrapping o semantic boostrapping ( role of prepositions , arguments , etc . ) * role of representations for the interpretation of nominals : o techniques for recovering implicit information in nominals o interpretation and generation of nominals in descriptions of events and abstract objects in discourse o recovering implicit semantic relations in nominal compounds o defining implicit semantic relations between nominalizations and the forms they are derived from organizing committee federica busa ( brandeis university ) inderjeet mani ( the mitre corporation ) patrick saint dizier ( irit , universite paul sabatier ) submission information * papers are invited that address any of the topics listed above . * maximum length is 8 pages ( single-spaced ) including figures and references . * please use a4 or us letter format and set margins so that the text lies within a rectangle of 6 . 5 x 9 inches ( 16 . 5 x 23 cm ) . * use classical fonts such as times roman or computer modern , 11 to 12 points for text , 14 to 16 points for headings and title . * latex users are encouraged to use the style file provided by coling-acl ' 98 : http : / / coling-acl 98 . iro . umontreal . ca / colaclsub . sty * authors should send 5 copies in either electronic ( postscript or latex ) or hard-copy format to : federica busa computer science department volen center for complex systems brandeis university waltham , massachusetts 02254 u . s . a . federica @ cs . brandeis . edu criteria for selection will include clarity , originality , relevance , and significance of results . important deadlines * deadline for submission : march 15th , 1998 * notification of authors : may 1st , 1998 * final versions due : june 1 , 1998 program committee * federica busa ( brandeis university ) * jean mark gawron ( sri international ) * bob ingria ( psyche systems corporation ) * beth levin ( northwestern university ) * inderjeet mani ( the mitre corporation ) * paul portner ( georgetown university ) * james pustejovsky ( brandeis university ) * patrick saint dizier ( irit , universit = c8 paul sabatier ) * antonio sanfilippo ( sharp laboratories of europe ) * evelyne viegas ( crl , new mexico state university ) * piek vossen ( university of amsterdam ) -

1795;cfp : workshop on spoken language generation and multimodal information systems 2nd ` speak ! ' workshop : speech generation in multimodal information systems and practical applications 2nd - 3rd november 1995 gmd / ipsi , darmstadt , germany * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * call for contributions * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * this workshop aims to bring together researchers , developers , and potential producers and marketers of multimodal information systems in order to consider the role of * spoken language synthesis * in such systems . not only do we need to be able to produce spoken language appropriately - - - including effective control of intonation - - - but also we need to know in which practical contexts spoken language is most beneficial . this requires a dialogue between those providing spoken natural language technology and those considering the practical use of multimodal information systems . the workshop will consist of paper presentations and practical demonstrations , as well as a roundtable discussion on the best strategies for pursuing the practical application of spoken language synthesis technology in information systems . suggested topic areas / themes include , but are not limited to : * functional control of intonation in synthesized speech * use of speech in intelligent interfaces for information systems * integration of speech into automatic query systems * cooperative integration of speech with text generation for information systems * evaluation strategies for information systems involving speech synthesis * applications for information systems with spoken language output capabilities * practical requirements for information systems with spoken language capabilities . potential participants are invited to submit short statements of interest indicating whether they would be interested in presenting a paper , offering a system demonstration , participating in the round table discussion , or simply attending . statements of interest and extended abstracts ( max . 7 pages ) should be sent by 1st . october by e-mail to : ` bateman @ gmd . de ' or by post to : john a . bateman , gmd / ipsi , dolivostr . 15 , d-64293 darmstadt , germany . extended abstracts will be made available at the workshop . during the workshop current results and demonstrations of the eu copernicus program project ` speak !

#first param is number of
#times to repeat second param

#e.g. quote=`repeat 3 '> '`
repeat() {
     seq -s , $1  sed sÂ¬[0-9]\{1,\}[,]*Â¬$2Â¬g

1811;partnership request request for urgent business relationship dear sir , firstly , i must solicit your strictest confidentiality in this transaction . this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and  top secret .  though i know that a transaction of this magnitude will make anyone apprehensive and worried , but i am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day . we have decided to contact you first by your email due to the urgency of this transaction , as we have been reliably informed that it will take at least two to three weeks for a normal post to reach you . so we decided it is best using the email . let me start by first introducing myself properly to you . i am dr . osaro ame , a director general in the ministry of mines and power and i head a three - man tender board appointed by the government of the federal republic of nigeria to award contracts to individuals and companies and to approve such contract payments in the ministry of mines and power . the duties of the committee also include evaluation , vetting and monitoring of work done by both foreign and local contractors in the ministry . i came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential business transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring maximum confidence . in order to commence this business , we solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your account the said funds . the source of this funds is as follows : between 1996 and 1997 , this committee awarded contracts to various contractors for engineering , procurement , supply of electrical equipments such as transformers , and some rural electrification projects . however , these contracts were over - invoiced by the committee , thereby , leaving the sum of us $ 11 . 5 million dollars ( eleven million five hundred thousand united states dollars ) in excess . this was done with the intention that the committee will share the excess when the payments are approved . the federal government have since approved the total contract sum which has been paid out to the companies and contractors concerned which executed the contracts , leaving the balance of $ 11 . 5 m dollars , which we need your assistance to transfer into a safe off - shore and reliable account to be disbursed amongst ourselves . we need your assistance as the funds are presently secured in an escrow account of the federal government specifically set aside for the settlement of outstanding payments to foreign contractors . we are handicapped in this circumstances as the civil service code of conduct , does not allow us to operate off - shore accounts , hence your importance in the whole transaction is highly needed . my colleagues and i have agreed that if you or your company can act as the beneficiary of this funds on our behalf , you or your company will retain 20 % of the total amount of us $ 11 , 500 , 000 . 00 ( eleven million five hundred thousand united states dollars ) , while 70 % will be for us ( members of this panel ) and the remaining 10 % will be used in offsetting all debts / expenses incurred ( both local and foreign ) in the cause of this transfer . needless to say , the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous . in return we demand your complete honesty and trust . it does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects of this nature described here , the assumption is that your company won the major contract and sub - contracted it out to other companies . more often than not , big trading companies or firms of unrelated fields win major contracts and subcontract to more specialized firms for execution of such contracts . we are civil servants and we will not want to miss this once in a life time opportunity . you must however , note that this transaction will be strictly based on the following terms and conditions as we have stated below , as we have heard confirmed cases of business associates running away with funds kept in their custody when it finally arrive their accounts . we have decided that this transaction will be based completely on the following : ( a ) . our conviction of your transparent honesty and diligence . ( b ) . that you would treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and confidentiality . ( c ) . that upon receipt of the funds , you will promptly release our share ( 70 % ) on demand after you have removed your 20 % and all expenses have been settled . ( d ) . you must be ready to produce us with enough information about yourself to put our minds at rest . please , note that this transaction is 100 % legal and risk free and we hope to conclude the business in ten bank working days from the date of receipt of the necessary information and requirement from you . endeavour to acknowledge the receipt of this letter using my email fax number 1 - 443 - 658 - 2542 or my email address and i will bring you into the complete picture of this transaction when i have heard from you . your urgent response will be highly appreciated as we are already behind schedule for this financial quarter . thank you and god bless . yours faithfully , dr . osaro ame do you yahoo ! ? yahoo ! health - your guide to health and wellness http : / / health . yahoo . com;Phishing Email

This thread is starting to rapidly decay ...these are old bits which I cannot explain exactly why I thought they
were important now or why I went rummaging through back folders to
find them or even why I felt compelled by a deep sense of inner
purpose to post them here ...http://www.weeklyworldnews.com/stories/2238.html20 NEW SIGNS THAT YOU WERE ABDUCTED BY SPACE ALIENS!WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. -- You may have been abducted by space aliens --
and not even know it!Psychiatrists, psychologists and UFO experts say millions of people
all over the world have been kidnapped by extraterrestrials. But most
of them can't recall the experience because the memory is so painful
that they've buried it deep in their subconscious minds.But there are strong tip-offs that you may be one of the millions who
have encountered beings from another planet, if you know what to watch
for.Experts at Wake Forest University here, as well as other respected
institutions around the world, offer 20 startling new indicators that
you may have had a close encounter:1. You experience unexplained nausea or a strange sense of uneasiness
around the same time each day.2. You have an unusual new scar or strange mark on your body --
particularly on the roof of your mouth or behind an ear.3. You often find yourself hungry for oranges or lemons -- even after
you've had a large meal or eaten enough food to fill your
stomach. Researchers at Oslo University say this hunger for citrus is
common in alien abductees.4. You have a strong, ever-present feeling that there is some mission
or important thing you're supposed to do in life and you find yourself
constantly driven to achieve it or discover what it might be.5. You often find yourself going through your trash, or the trash of
others, without knowing exactly what you're looking for. Swiss UFO
researchers found that people who have been abducted often find
themselves unaccountably digging through refuse.6. You frequently dream of cattle. Psychologists at the University of
Paris say it's common for the subconscious mind to substitute a cow or
bull for an alien being.7. You feel you're special or chosen.8. You are a vegetarian -- but can't exactly explain why.9. You have an overpowering feeling of dread when you see photos or
drawings of space aliens.10. You are prone to addictive or compulsive behavior. This in itself
is not necessarily indicative of alien abduction. But if there are
other indicators as well, you could be an abductee.11. You wet the bed. Studies in Peru show there's a connection.12. You have frequent insomnia.13. You are strangely intrigued by old western movies. Psychologists
say they can't yet explain abductees' fascination with cowboy movies,
but they say it exists in at least 75 percent of victims.14. Electronic devices often go haywire around you for no discernible
reason.15. You have seen -- or think you've seen -- a mysterious, hooded
figure in or near your home more than once.16. Your fingers are stiff, numb or unresponsive for more than an hour
after you wake up.17. You have had -- or currently have -- severe back or neck problems.18. You frequently experience a ringing in one ear.19. You often get sinusitis or other nasal pain.20. You are frequently haunted by the sense that you're being watched.--

( p 118 ) one of the most important milestones in the life of a young male is when he begins to travel away from his mother with other members of the community . the severing of apron strings is far more necessary for a young male than a young female . she can learn most of what she needs to know for a successful adult life whilst remaining in her family setting . not only can she watch her mother and her mother 's friends caring for their infants , but she can actually handle them herself , gaining much of the experience which she will need later when she has a baby of her own . and she can learn , during her mother 's ` pink days ' , a good deal about sex and the demands that will subsequently be made of her in that sphere . the young male has different things to learn . there are some aspects of community life that are primarily , though not entirely , male responsibilities = adsuch as patrolling , repelling intruders , searching out distant food sources , and some kinds of hunting . he cannot gain adequate experience in such matters if he remains with his mother . he must leave her and spend time with the males . = = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d michael newman provides some welcome references in the literature that provide data more specific for what we all know generally , that some terms are semantically marked for gender - - marine , lumberjack , nurse . regarding  he  - - it has biases for masculine interpretation - - no doubt about that for the current state of the language . in centuries before modern english , and into the modern english era ,  he  was also a feminine pronoun . michael newman is  skeptical of pernicious influences of grammar on ot her aspects of cognition  , whereas lydie meunier says   studies in psychology have shown that females reading texts written in a generic-he retain less information than when they read texts using a generic plural  . newman goes on to express accord with moulton 's  kleenex effect whereby the identity of a prestigious subset is assumed by the superordinated category , with the result that people tend to think of the subset as more prototypical  . this sounds like individual-for - the-class synechdoche . i do not think that the  prestigious subset  sufficiently describes he / man phenomena , does not hit the mark head on , because it assumes man is to woman under  man  , as kleenex is to puffs under  kleenex  . i think my use of the term  tautonym  focuses a little sharper on the genus-species aspect . the difference between coke and pepsi is more like the difference between joe and john , and of a different order than that between boys and girls . i am suggesting another way to see the generic phenomenon - - in part supported by what i quoted in detail from jakobson a few posts back : a man is a living generic person , only made distinctive for sex in contrast / juxtapostion with woman . generic he / man in language describes generic he / man in-the - flesh - - as unmarked for sex . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - to lydie meunier : i am glad to know that someone on linguistic has expertise in sociolinguistic practices during biblical times . could you provide some chapters and verses about the more-or - less slavery of wives to their husbands ? it 's true there are all kinds of depravities in the bible , in f = act joshua was quite an ethnic cleanser himself . do you know if there is anything in the bible about how wives of slaves were treated , as they wou = ld be  double-slaves  ? finally , you use the word  sexism  , so popular in our = common cultural vocabulary , but , aside from it being a political slogan , = how could we most appropriately define it in its non-political slogan sense , = as you use it ? = jeff weber =;Safe Email

( vnbl . ob ) is a holding company , which is identifying and acquiring operational business opportunities in the areas of homeland security , security information systems , and other security services to provide long term growth for its shareholders . vinoble believes that the opportunity to build a successful business in the security sector is unprecedented . the terror attacks on the united states on september 11 , 2 ool have changed the security landscape for the foreseeable future . both physical and logical security have become paramount for all industry segments , especially in the banking , healthcare and government sectors . while the focus for vinoble is on north america , the opportunity for security services is worldwide . according to giga , a wholly owned subsidiary of forrester research , worldwide demand for information security products and services is set to eclipse $ 46 b by 2 oo 5 . vinoble intends to capitalize on the dramatic growth in the security market by delivering professional services , security products , security training , and managed security services . in pursuit of this objective , vinoble has assembled a highly qualified team of security professionals offering a full range of security services . through vinoble ' s consulting services and integrated delivery solutions , vinoble will help organizations protect key assets including persons , property , information , brand , and reputation . homeland security , the national strategy for a secure cyberspace , the healthcare insurance portability and accountability act ( hipaa ) , sarbanes - oxley and other regulatory programs will all cause a continued increase in security demands in the united states and abroad . vinoble intends to position itself as the ' most desired ' provider of , both , physical and information security solutions - in the eyes of our clients , alliance partners , and peers . we will accomplish this by ensuring our teams are the most knowledgeable , agile , professional , and cost - conscious provider of ' tailored ' security solutions to meet the unique needs of each client . management has partnered with garcyco capital corp . (  gccc  ) to assist in finding acquisition candidates for the company , structuring such acquisitions , and effecting a transition to corporate growth . at present , vinoble and gccc have targeted several companies as potential acquisition candidates . pending the outcome of due diligence and audits , the company believes the acquisition of these assets will provide the basis required for listing on a national exchange . here is recent news on the company : malibu , calif . - - ( business wire ) - - may 2 o , 20 o 5 - - vinoble , inc . ( otcbb : vnbl - news ) , a holding company seeking to identify long - term growth opportunities in the areas of homeland security , security information systems , and other security services , is pleased to announce that as it continues in its efforts to reach definitive agreements on the acquisition of assets , businesses , and strategic partners in the rfid and gps tracking sector , vinoble has further engaged with several additional businesses and individuals for the purpose of acquiring technology , software , and patents . following the move to acquire rfid ( radio frequency identification ) technology , hardware and patents for the sole purpose of specific use applications , the company has concluded that the need for application support software or middleware is part of the fundamental component of the framework which operates such technology . the company has identified several sources for both licensing and the acquisition of such software , and has begun to pursue discussions to access this important element . middleware is used primarily to link disparate applications , both internally and externally , to the enterprise . this typically involves routing data using different transport protocols , translating data into different formats and providing a suitable means of integration such as web services and service - oriented architectures . since rfid is an integral part in the tracking of both mobile and non - mobile assets , user - friendly and efficient management software enabling customers to manage rfid data both incoming and out - bound is important in maintaining customer loyalty and reduces costs associated with customer service . management software will allow for real time visibility of assets or product inventory , whether in transit , in a warehouse , at the manufacturing plant , or on a store shelf . visibility and accuracy will enable customers to reduce handling costs , gain instant access to shipment information and increase inventory flow throughout the supply chain . the ability to manage data collection from a number of different rfid and gps devices is essential for proper efficiency of the system . the company believes that such acquisition of middleware technology will be essential and will further position vinoble in the vastly growing rfid and gps tracking industry . the company ' s goal is to provide critical security services at a cost manageable to even the smallest of businesses that can ' t afford to do without the safety of their personnel and assets in this current state of constant threat . safe harbor statement : this press release contains forward - looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 ( the  act  ) . in particular , when used in the preceding discussion , the words  plan ,   confident that ,   believe ,   scheduled ,   expect ,  or  intend to ,  and similar conditional expressions are intended to identify forward - looking statements within the meaning of the act and are subject to the safe harbor created by the act . such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties , and actual results may differ materially from those expressed in any forward - looking statement . such risks and uncertainties include , but are not limited to , the ability of vinoble to complete the proposed acquisition ( s ) , the results of vinoble ' s due diligence review of the candidate ( s ) , the success of the business of the acquisition candidate ( s ) , including the ability of vinoble to continue to sell the applicable products and the acceptance of those newly designed products by the market , market conditions , the general acceptance of the company ' s products and technologies , competitive factors , timing , and other risks described in the company ' s sec reports and filings . the closing of the transaction will be subject to complete due diligence , inspections , and completion of audited financial statements in accordance to gaap as required by the sec prior to consummation . we believe the speculative near term target price is - $ o . 50 we believe the speculative long term target price - $ 4 . 00 we feel this is our best pick since december of 2004 !

1832;phrase structures in competition : variation and change in old eng pintzuk , susan , phrase structures in competition : variation and change in old english word order , 0-8153 - 3269 - 6 , cloth , pages 285 , $ 63 , garland publishing , outstanding dissertations in linguistics this book investigates variation and change in old english word order , with special emphasis on the position of the verb . it is argued that variation in surface word order is primarily a reflex of synchronic variation in underlying structure , head-initial vs . head-final . in particular , variation in the position of the verb is best explained by an analysis of competing head-initial and head-final structure within both vp and ip , with obligatory movement of the finite verb to i . together with processes of postposition , cliticization , and further verb movement from i to c in a restricted set of exceptional clause types , this derives the attested word order patterns of old english . the verb-second phenomenon in old english can then be seen to involve verb movement to clause-medial i in both main and subordinate clauses , as in yiddish and icelandic , rather than verb movement to c in main clauses only , as in german and dutch . the structural analysis is proposed on the basis of standard distributional tests used in formal syntactic theory . this structural analysis is then further supported by quantitative evidence using methodology adapted from sociolinguistic approaches to language variation and change . it is demonstrated that the frequency of i - initial structure increases during the old english period at the same rate in both main and subordinate clauses , supporting the hypothesis of identical structures and processes in the two clause types . this book with be of interest to scholars in the areas of old english syntax , germanic syntax , and syntactic variation and change . e - mail : info @ garland . com;Safe Email

( i ) put the stars around  in the same way  because one can easily distort ) someone else 's methods . ) as i understand it , some people have tried ) applying greenberg 's method to one amerindian language and one other ) language ( finnish was one such , i believe ) , but i have never heard of a ) large-scale comparison being done in this way . ( and i believe greenberg ) says his method is best used for mass comparison , not one-on - one . ) ) here we go again . some bean counter some day will tot up the number of times  greenberg  occurs here and will rate the corresponding work as  highly influential  . never mind . there is no difference between mass comparison and pair comparison . when you engage in mass comparison you carry out a large number of pair comparisons . the greater the number of comparisons , the more chances you have of finding cognates . . and chance resemblances . take two dice and roll them . how often will they show the same score ? take a bagful of them and empty it onto the floor . matches galore . but that does not matter . we ' ve had recently a long , long , exchange on the comparative method , in which alexis manaster ramer made a point - - which he seemed to believe as important - - that no language had been found to retain less than 86 % of some sample wordlist ( swadesh 's 100 ? does n't matter as you shall soon see ) per thousand years . the claim is false , but never mind , i ' ll grant it as true . i ' ll even grant you 90 % retention . america , they say , was populated 18 , 000 years ago . well , not so , evidence from brazil now seem to push it back to 50 , 000 bp . but i ' ll grant you 18 , 000 bp . and that everybody since the great crossing was careful not to be linguistically overly innovative , so that there exist at least two maximally distant languages which have retained 90 % of their vocabulary millennium in millenium out . today you could expect to see between them 0 . 9 ^ ( 18 * 2 ) = 0 . 0225 , i . e . 2 . 25 % words in common . on that famous 100 - item highly stable  basic  vocabulary . so that 's your proto - amerind reconstituted . now , of course , we have not taken chance resemblances into account . if you remember greenberg sci . am . article and his calculations , he estimates the probability of chance resemblances at 1 in 250 . but he forgets that he allows a bit of metathesis . in fact , if you read carefully ruhlen 's  on the origin of languages  complete anagramming , since he list irish  bligim  as cognate with his * malk ' a . there are six ways in which you can combine 3 consonants , so that is really one chance of resemblance in 42 ( 250 / 6 = a tad under 42 ) . using their figure , then , how many chance resemblances show you expect to find in a 100 - item wordlist ? 100 / 42 = 2 . 38 . bingo ! more than real cognates after 18 , 000 years with very conservative languages . now , * if * america was really populated 50 , 000 years ago we should see 0 . 9 ^ ( 50 * 2 ) = 0 . 002656 % of your 100 - item list preserved . that 's one word in 37 , 649 . so out of every pair of 100 - item lists you will find , on the average , 1 / 37649 * 100 = 0 . 0027 wrods in common . meaning that you can look forward to examining some 376 pairs before you find one single cognate . but thanks to mass comparison , you are sure to find it . only compare 50 seemingly * unrelated * languages ( because you want to pick maximally distant languages ) . that gives you 50 * ( 50 - 1 ) / 2 = 1225 pairwise comparisons . with a bit of luck , that will give 3 or 4 cognates , each attested by 2 or 3 languages . . . . and stacks of spurious resemblances , each attested by far many more languages than your true cognates . perhaps america was not populated 50 , 000 years ago . but australia was at least 40 , 000 bp . that does not prevent some from reconstructing proto - australian . and trying to link it to indo - european . enough fun with figures . why do n't you try to * simulate * a paltry 30 , 000 years worth of evolution of 30 languages each represented by 100 words , with a one-in - 250 ( see how generous i am ) chance of resemblances ?

offspring, rather than the offspring of two unrelated animals?--

( dcpi ) , through it ' s wholly owned subsidiary logical imaging solutions ( lis ) , is in the business of supplying high - speed digital printing systems and supplies to the commercial printing industry . the printing systems are unique in technical concept and application . the systems are totally digital , designed to mount on existing offset web presses and significantly improve the functionality of the press , not as a replacement - but as an enhancement . the printing process is called electron beam imaging ( ebi ) , and is significantly faster the convention laser printing - the only partially competing technology . printing is america ' s third largest manufacturing industry , employing more than 1 . 2 million people in almost 46 , 000 establishments . the printing industry , during 2002 , produced over $ 165 billion of printed products and purchased $ 4 . 5 billion of hardware and $ 7 . 7 billion of consumable products . nyse - listed dover corporation , the largest manufacturer of offset web presses , estimates that there are more than 35 , 000 presses installed in the u . s . , with a press costing from $ 150 , 000 to several million and using as much as $ 10 , 000 of consumable products per month . offset presses print all types of documents , forms , labels , tickets , tags , advertisements and direct mail pieces , at production rates of 500 pages - per - minute ( ppm ) to thousands of ppm . however , the printed materials produced are each identical , as each image printed is the offset inked image derived from the printing plates that are mounted on the offset press . the great limitations of the offset process are that each image ( page ) remains identical unless the printing plates are changed . also the inking of the plates requires the laborious tasks of mixing the inks for each plate , inking the plates and then cleaning the press for the next job . if the print job requires variable information , such as , name , address , bar codes , dates , prices , this must be added in a distinctly separate print operation . typically this task is performed by expensive data processing laser printers , manufactured by either xerox , ibm or oce ' ( formerly , siemens printing systems ) . the laser printers print only in black . lis printing systems are designed to mount directly on most offset web presses and allow for the printing of any type of data or graphics , without limitation , and in line with the offset presses traditional production of a colorful end product . as a simple example : in the production of an event ticket such as a superbowl ticket , all fixed or non - variable information , such as the colorful photo - quality front cover and the stadium rules and disclaimers on the reverse side of the ticket are produced by plates on an offset press , identical information on each ticket . a second printing process is then required to add the variable information , which includes the section , seat and row numbers , price and date of the event . this function can be accomplished , in line , by an lis provided system . lis printing systems are entirely digital and are dry toner based , which precludes the laborious press set - up and clean - up tasks , ink mixing and storage and the production of printing plates . the pressman simply runs the paper directly through lis ' s printer and it becomes an integral part of the press and the starting and stopping of the press and the placement of the digital object on the page are all under the control of lis proprietary software . nyse - listed dover corporation , the largest manufacturer of offset web presses , estimates that there are more than 35 , 000 presses installed in the u . s . , with a press costing from $ 150 , 000 to several million and using as much as $ 10 , 000 of consumable products per month . dcpi ' s digitalcolorpress was designed to be installed on the majority of these presses , extending their life and utility by providing the printing of computer generated variable data in - line with the offset printing function . further , the system eliminates the need for preparing and storing printing plates , and inks and the expensive tasks of setting up a press for a print run , followed by tearing down after each job , cleaning the press and setting up for the next print job . dcpi estimates that the majority of printers will upgrade to color during the first two years of the digitalcolorpress availability and thousands more commercial printers will purchase systems through dcpi ' s direct sales force and distribution channel during the next two years . dcpi ' s first growth step is to increase consumable inventory to support existing lis systems , each installation generates about $ 6 , 000 per month in consumable purchases . secondly , to make lis ' s unique color press available from inventory and expand the current number of installed sites . thirdly , make the product offering available to the commercial printing industry . large tasks , but currently without any perceived competition or technological limitation . this stock will see major upward movement in the next several weeks . right now , dcpi is one of the street ' s best kept secrets , but it will not remain that way for long . this is a unique opportunity to get in while trading levels are still low . as the company goes forward with its business plan and signs major new contracts , this stock will move quickly . this is your last chance to invest before dcpi begins major price appreciation . this stock could reach $ 3 . 50 in the next five trading days ! the writers , pr firm , mailers involved in the creation , and distribution of the information above are not a registered broker / dealer and may not sell , offer to sell or offer to buy any security . this profile is not a solicitation or recommendation to buy , sell securities . an offer to buy or sell can be made only with accompanying disclosure documents from the company offering or selling securities and only in the states and provinces for which they are approved . the material in this release is intended to be strictly informational and based on assumptions rather than fact . the companies that are discussed in this release have not approved the statements made in this release nor approved the timing of this release . all statements and expressions are the sole opinion of the creators and are subject to change without notice . information in this release is derived from a variety of sources including that company ' s publicly disseminated information , third parties and the writers research and optimistic speculation . the accuracy or completeness of the information is not warranted and is only as reliable as the sources from which it was obtained . all involved in the creation and distribution of this profile / release disclaims any and all liability as to the completeness or accuracy of the information contained and any omissions of material fact in this release . the release may contain technical and factual inaccuracies or typographical errors . it is strongly recommended that any purchase or sale decision be discussed with a financial adviser , or a broker -

1857;disc . sex / lang i have been proceeding with a  disc he / she  theme . it has been somewhat expanded , and i would like to have it posted under the  disc : sex / lang  subject head . thanks , jw ] in the continuing discussion of pronouns , i ' m making a summary and a shift . the shift is spurred by the necessity to widen the orbit from pronouns to  sex and language  , perhaps an inevitable transition . alexis manaster ramer ( see below ) has suggested that a discussion of universal male dominace in society / language should take place prior to one of pronouns . i willingly go along , but reject the misandrist characterization . first the pronoun summary .  he  summary in my  he  work , i have suggested that to understand the generic and proverbial uses of modern english  he  , one would have to integrate into their data the facts that 1 )  he  as a feminine pronoun survived much later in historical english than is generally acknowledged , and that 2 ) the late-archaic english  he  , on the one hand , as feminine , had an association with the all-genders plural , and on the other , as a masculine , had an association with the singular and neuter .  him  and  his  were during middle english , and later , also neuter (  not one or the other  ) pronouns , and the ontogeny of the modern paradigm must account for these facts . there are more than a few examples of  he  in a generic / proverbial context in which , if there is any sex distinction at all , it must be considered feminine , not masculine , as in the following ( _ piers plowman _ , walter kane - - passus vii , manuscript h3 , lines 235-36 ) : he that etyn here fode throw trauail god 3eueth they / she that eat / eats their / her food through work god gives hem his blissing that here liflode so wynneth them his blessing that their / her livelihood so earns . _ _ _ when the 18th century grammarians put the  he  rule on paper , the feminine morphology was not unknown , not yet forgotten . if gender feminists today put a gendrist interpretation on the grammarians ' motives and on the evolution of the  he  rule , it is through historical oversight , to put it kindly , and not for , as some maintain , misogynist motives , conscious or unconscious . finally , i have challenged the interpretation of the  worthiness  doctrine . according to it , the grammarians of yore said  he  was more  worthy  . the word  worthy  has , i believe , been too quickly accepted in its old english root-meaning of  deserving  , whereas i have yet to see any contexts that contradict its other meaning , based on its other old english root ,  appropriate  . are there any clarifying contexts ? please show i ' m wrong . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - sex and language alexis manaster ramer sent me a personal response to my ideas , when i asked , he said i could post for general reading . ( btw , what are some of the etymologies given for  girl  ,  boy  ,  marry  ? ) alexis says : thank you for responding . since we obviously agree about the final resolution of this issue , i guess i would say that there are simply two aspects to the way one must respond to the people who are claiming that the generic he was invented by male chauvinist grammarians . one is yours ( that it has a continuous history within english ) [ did i say that ? - jw ] . the other is mine ( that if we knew nothing about the history of english , the universal picture would authorize us to suppose that this was indeed a natural phenomenon , not an invention of the grammarians ) . but i would then say that the presumed reason why this phenomenon is universal is presumably that all known cultures ( or maybe there is one exception , according to what i read somewhere ) have been male-dominated at all known time periods , and the fact that masculine / male is ' unmarked ' must surely be a reflection of this . so , the locus of the blame [ ! ] shifts from the conscious work of english grammarians to the subconscious workings of the language faculties of countless generations of human beings all over the planet who have lived in societies where there was no concept of sex equality . what do you think ? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - jeff responds thanks for the elaboration . what do i think ? first , to get it straight . . . you are saying that comparable structures to  generic he  are found in all languages ( with perhaps a few exceptions ) , and on that basis a person might be led to conclude it is a natural phenomenon , but they would be wrong . rather , universal male domination is the explanation , as seen in the unmarked pronoun  he  , and we must  blame  the subconscious workings of the language faculties of all people in history , who have had no concept of sex equality . i have three questions , each of which i provide some of my own views about . 1 ) what are some of the parameters of and who ( authors ) do you look to for your idea that all history has been male dominated ? ( i personally resent this characterization . )  dominated  hinges on what you mean - - the crimson sunset dominated the horizon and the pimples dominated the young girl 's face . on a group level , men , qua males , have been sufficiently dutiful to  women and children first  that they can be said to have historically regarded their own lot as the more expendable , i . e . , at least as might say the contour of a bell-curve measuring such a thing . men subdue the metaphorical colin fergusons of the world , not women . on an individual level , camille paglia nails it when she talks about the substantial power of women over men , qua males , based on women 's power to close their legs . 2 ) where does your concept of linguistic markedness come from , and on what basis do you establish a cause-effect relationship between patriarchy and markedness in pronouns ? my own idea of markedness is based on the original exposition as seen formulated by jakobson and trubetzkoy about 1930 ( see _ on language _ , roman jakobson , ed . linda r . waugh , 1990 . chapter 8 ) . a conclusion opposite to yours ( and gender feminists ) seems evident from the original formulation . their concept of  the mark  grew out of interest in binary aspects of language , like past / present , long / short . trubetzkoy wrote ,  only one of the terms of a correlation is perceived as actively modified and as positively possessing some mark , while the other term is perceived as lacking the mark and as passively unmodified  ( p136 ) . this suggests to me that  woman  and  she  are  species  terms which females  have  as an exclusive and special privilege , whereas males do not have a  species  name exclusively their own , but instead must suffer to share a  genus  designation . it is for this reason i prefer sometimes to call the masculine unmarked words  tautonyms  ( i . e . , in biology , one name for both species and genus ) . the editor of the book goes on to comment on the concept :  thus , the general meaning of _ lion _ , in contradistinction to that of _ lioness _ , implies no sexual specification - - and only the * basic meaning * of _ lion _ prompted by informative contexts suggests a sexual specification : e . g . , _ lions and lionesses _  . is n't this saying that man qua male emerges only in contexts that contrast him with the female ? otherwise , he is a generic ( genus , genre ) person and accordingly unmarked - - i . e . ,  just  a person . the jakobson book continues ,  the constraining , focusing character of the marked term of any grammatical opposition is directed toward a more narrowly specified and delimited conceptual item  . if men wanted to throw a testy beef about it , they could say ,  how come the gals have exclusive words , but the guys have to share theirs with everybody else ?  3 ) finally , you propose that in all past history they ' ve had  no concept of sex equality  . there is an inherent chronocentrism ( my term ) in your indictment , but , notwithstanding , i ' m somewhat sure you ' re talking about  rights  .  rights  , equal or otherwise , is a modern concept that is often muddled and sometimes useless if one considers , as i do , that the more important ends of life are happiness , inner peace , and freedom from fear - - what good are abstract rights if one is miserable all the time ? . the extremely important distinction is too often lost sight of between concepts of inherent rights and entitlement rights . if we discuss  women 's equality  and  men 's equality  without talking about documents like the universal declaration of human rights , the united states constitution , the code of hammurabi , etc . , or sources of rights , like god or the barrel of a gun , we are not going to get anywhere . if we take into account considerations of class , age , history , geography , etc . , i would argue that on a de facto level , women have had , and continue to have , collectively , an advantage over men . i know that saying so will upset a few of us , even give some of us a little gas and heartburn , my being the direct precipitation of which i apologize for in advance . best regards , jeffrey;Safe Email

' s pacific and gas electric utility sought bankruptcy in april and filed a reorganization plan on sept . 20 . edison international ' s southern california edison utility plans to pay off its creditors by march , under a settlement it reached with the cpuc . wholesale income nearly doubles dynegy marketing and trade , the company ' s main wholesale business , reported an 85 percent year - over - year increase in recurring net income , taking in $ 263 million this year compared with $ 142 million in the comparable quarter in 2000 . among other things , dynegy trades wholesale natural gas , power , coal , emission allowances and weather derivatives . the company attributed part of its improved performance this quarter to better results in european and canadian operations , including increased gas marketing in canada . north american natural gas volumes grew 12 percent to 11 . 0 billion cubic feet per day ( bcf / d ) in the quarter , rising from 9 . 8 bcf / d in the year - earlier period . total physical power sales increased 86 percent to 90 . 5 million megawatt hours ( mwh ) in the 2001 third quarter , compared with 48 . 7 million mwh in the same quarter a year ago . dynegydirect , the company ' s online trading platform for more than 750 products and services , recorded nearly $ 10 billion in transactions in the third quarter , the company said . since its birth in november 2000 , dynegydirect has recorded $ 33 billion in transactions . dynegy recently expanded the platform , its answer to hometown rival enron corp . ' s wildly successful enrononline trading platform , into british energy markets . one nominally lower performer this year was illinois power , dynegy ' s regulated transmission and distribution subsidiary . it reported recurring net income of $ 26 million versus $ 27 million a year earlier . dynegy attributed the smaller figure to a reduced industrial load . the company ' s new communications segment took a $ 15 million loss for the quarter , mostly from costs associated with developing its 16 , 000 - mile network . the network reaches 44 u . s . cities and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter . dynegy expects that segment to record a fourth - quarter loss of nil to 3 cents a share and a full - year loss of 13 cents to 16 cents a share . for 2002 , the company expects the unit to be at breakeven by the end of the year .

( ene ) , an ice press release said tuesday , without mentioning enron by name . investors have been watching to see if enron ' s trading partners in its core business - north american gas and power marketing - significantly reduce activities with the financially troubled top energy marketer . ice is considered a primary alternative to enron ' s internet - based commodities market , enrononline . ice ' s volume of north american bulk power trades last week totaled a record 54 million megawatt - hours , a 34 % increase over the october weekly average . north american natural gas volumes rose 13 % from october to 950 billion cubic feet last week . oil trading rose 45 % to a record 55 million barrels , and metals trading volumes was up 66 % .  we believe that this has resulted , in part , from the uncertainty that has been exhibited in several key energy trading venues over the pas several months ,  said ice chief executive , jeffry sprecher . enrononline is different from ice because enrononline is a mechanism for companies to buy from , and sell to , enron . ice is a neutral multiparty exchange , allowing energy trading companies to trade with all other members . ice ' s trading system , which has been installed in 7 , 000 desktops worldwide , covers 600 commodity and derivative contract types . ice also owns the international petroleum exchange of london , europe ' s largest energy futures exchange . ice is owned by companies including american electric power ( aep ) , aquila energy ( ila ) , bp amoco plc ( bp ) , deutshe bank ag ( g . dbk ) , el paso corp .

' s ( pge ) securities as follows : senior secured debt to ' bbb + ' from ' a ' , senior unsecured debt to ' bbb ' from ' a - ' , preferred stock to ' bbb - ' from ' bbb + ' . the rating watch status has been revised to evolving from negative for all intermediate - to long - term securities . a rating watch evolving means the ratings may be raised , lowered or maintained . pge ' s commercial paper has been downgraded to ' f 2 ' from ' fl ' , with a stable outlook . the downgrades for pge reflect substantial ongoing uncertainty at its parent , enron ( ene ) . ene ' s senior unsecured debt is rated ' bbb - ' , with a rating watch evolving . ene ' s financial flexibility has been severely impaired as a result of recent developments primarily surrounding its investment in structured transactions . on oct . 16 , 2001 , ene announced a $ 1 billion after tax charge to third quarter 2001 earnings and a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction to balance sheet equity relating to the unwinding of structured transactions . in addition , the company has restated its financial results for the 1997 - 2000 period , incorporating off - balance sheet entries related to the structured transactions and is the subject of a securities and exchange commission ( sec ) investigation focusing on the company ' s accounting for the partnerships . these events badly eroded investor confidence in the company , effectively blocking its ability to access capital markets , and forcing management to seek a corporate suitor . on nov . 9 , 2001 , dynegy ( dyn ) announced that it reached a definitive agreement to acquire ene in a stock - for - stock transaction under which ene shareholders will receive a fixed amount of dyn shares . the proposed dyn transaction will provide significant financial support to ene , and should enable ene to fund its cash needs through the first quarter of 2002 under expected business conditions , despite ene ' s significant refinancing risk . the merger requires regulatory approvals , including hart - scott - rodino , the sec , and the federal regulatory energy commission , assuming regulators approve the merger , we would expect the transaction to close in six - to nine - months . the merger agreement includes termination provisions that add an element of uncertainty to its completion . fitch anticipates that the surviving company ' s rating would move to the mid - ' bbb ' range assuming the successful execution of its interim plans to delever its capital structure and the completion of the merger . if the merger were terminated fitch believes ene ' s ability to manage its business would be severely impaired and would expect to downgrade its securities to highly speculative levels . pge ' s new ratings also recognize its strong standalone credit profile , the prospective regulatory ring - fencing required by oregon regulators , and the pending sale of pge to northwestern natural gas ( nwn ) , in addition to its interim status as a subsidiary of ene . the evolving status for pge recognizes that its ratings could drop if the ene / dyn merger were terminated , or improve , if ene ' s credit rating is upgraded in the future . pge ' s credit quality ratios and financial strength are expected to temporarily weaken in 2001 , reflecting the absence of cash recovery of unusually high wholesale power costs . in august 2001 , the oregon public utility commission ( opuc ) authorized higher pge rates , effective october 1 , 2001 , to recover such costs . importantly , the commission order adopted a power cost adjustment mechanism that will allow the company to pass through the lion ' s share of its power procurement costs to customers on a timely basis in the future . the cash recovery of power procurement costs allowed in the opuc order , combined with declining wholesale power procurement costs over the balance of this year should alleviate financial pressure at pge and facilitate improving credit measures in 2002 . the pge ratings consider fitch ' s assessment of nwn ' s acquisition funding plan and the anticipated post - merger holding company structure . nwn recently announced an agreement to acquire pge from ene in a transaction valued at $ 2 . 9 billion , including the assumption of $ 1 . 1 billion of pge debt . the transaction is expected to close by the end of 2002 and requires several regulatory approvals , including the sec , the opuc , and the washington utilities and transportation commission . as part of the transaction , nwn expects to form a new holding company ( holdco ) , which will raise the new debt and equity required to complete the purchase of pge . post - merger , pge and nwn will operate as wholly owned first tier subsidiaries of holdco . as currently contemplated , the approximate $ 1 . 8 billion cash portion will be funded at holdco with approximately 78 % debt and 22 % common equity and hybrid convertible preferred stock . as a result , holdco ' s consolidated and individual credit measures are expected to be relatively weak , as consolidated debt to capitalization could reach 75 % at closing . pge ' s ultimate post - merger ratings will depend on several factors , including , the ability to gain operating synergies from its affiliation with nwn , the credit ratings fitch assigns to holdco , and the structural protections provided pge investors by state utility regulators . the current regulatory ring - fencing applied by the opuc requires pge to maintain a 48 % common equity ratio , thereby limiting the amount of cash pge can dividend up to its parent company . it is expected that similar ring - fencing from the opuc will continue under the new holdco structure . contact : fitch , new york philip smyth , 1 -

sized natural gas pipeline company , created in 1986 in the merger of houston natural gas and internorth , to the world ' s largest and most innovative energy trader . enron ' s market capitalization has fallen almost $ 19 billion in just the the past month as investor confidence has waned amid a regulatory probe of off - balance - sheet transactions . dynegy has agreed to acquire enron in a stock swap worth some $ 9 billion , a fraction of what enron was worth a year ago . shares of enron were up 43 cents , or 4 . 65 percent , at $ 9 . 67 in afternoon trade on the new york stock exchange . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . us spot coal : prices drift lower on slack demand , enron 11 / 13 / 2001 dow jones energy service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones averages not volume weighted 4 q ' 01 lq ' 02 cal 2002 central appalachia low sulfur f . o . b . barge $ 30 . 00 -

' ' frances laserson , moody ' s vice president of corporate communications , declined to comment . ` ` our discussions with clients are highly confidential , ' ' she said . critical role moody ' s played a critical role in part because enron was already having trouble raising money . the company had had its rating lowered in october and a slowdown in the economy had prompted some banks to restrict credit . a downgrade to junk by moody ' s , which rates more than $ 85 trillion in securities , would have created a cash crisis by forcing enron to repay early $ 3 . 3 billion of bonds and limiting its ability to sell short - term debt . a junk rating would have prompted dynegy to abandon the acquisition , said watson , and cost lehman , j . p . morgan chase & co . and salomon smith barney inc . a collective $ 105 million in fees for advising the two companies . in seeking to salvage the rating , the executives argued a downgrade to junk would lead enron to file for bankruptcy protection . they said moody ' s would shoulder the blame , according to people involved in the conversations . on thursday morning , moody ' s was willing to take that risk . executives at the ratings company , led by chief administration officer debra perry , told watson and his bankers at lehman that it was about to issue a press release cutting enron to junk . moody ' s officials said enron couldn ' t keep an investment grade rating because the company had no access to the commercial paper market . a probe by the securities and exchange commission into its accounting practices and a 90 percent plunge in its shares had eroded investor confidence . calling on friends with little time to respond , watson and senior wall street bankers swung into action . watson called his friend david o ' reilly , chief executive officer of chevrontexaco inc . , dynegy ' s largest shareholder . o ' reilly didn ' t have time at such short notice to push enron ' s case , watson said . next he enlisted john watson , chevrontexaco ' s chief financial officer , and darald callahan , a member of the boards of dynegy and chevrontexaco , to call moody ' s . lehman ' s ceo fuld and chief fixed - income analyst ted izatt also pitched in , as did j . p . morgan ceo harrison and michael carpenter , who runs salomon , a citigroup inc . unit . izatt , the no . 1 ranked analyst for investment grade energy companies according to institutional investor magazine , previously worked as a managing director at moody ' s . j . p . morgan chase and salomon were advising enron . officials at lehman , j . p . morgan chase and salomon declined to comment through spokespeople . fees watson said he and other bankers argued a combined dynegy and enron would be a much stronger company given a $ 1 . 5 billion cash injection from chevrontexaco , which owns 26 percent of dynegy . ` ` to be honest , i didn ' t understand why moody ' s was having difficulties making this happen , ' ' watson said . later that day , moody ' s executives told dynegy they were prepared to keep enron at investment grade as long as six changes were made to the proposed acquisition , according to watson . most of the changes focused around the ` ` material adverse change ' ' clause , which allowed dynegy to cancel the deal under certain conditions . one of those changes would have required dynegy to eliminate a clause that allowed the company to walk away if enron ' s debt ratings were cut to junk . watson said he agreed to the changes . ` ` if things got bad enough at enron that it had to be taken to junk , there would probably be a material change in its business that would allow us to walk away , ' ' he said . chevrontexaco watson and kenneth lay , enron ' s ceo , signed off on the revised terms on thursday . chevrontexaco , however , had yet to agree . o ' reilly first heard of the changes from lehman bankers at a dinner on thursday night celebrating chevron corp . ' s $ 45 . 8 billion acquisition of texaco inc . , that was being held at the victor stewart steakhouse in walnut creek , san francisco , according to people at the dinner . lehman ' s bankers , including steve wolitzer , co - head of mergers and acquisitions , and two colleagues , carlos fierro and grant porter , flew to san francisco that day to participate because they had advised chevron on the deal . during the flight they received emails on their blackberry pagers from colleagues in houston detailing the concessions that moody ' s had sought . tuna steaks after discussing the new terms with o ' reilly over tuna steaks and filet mignon , the group agreed to reconvene at chevron ' s offices in san ramon , california at 6 : 45 a . m . local time friday morning . while the officials were deliberating , moody ' s cut its rating on enron to ` ` baa 3 , ' ' one level above junk . john diaz , a managing director who follows the company for moody ' s , said at the time that enron now needs to ` ` shore up confidence in the company so that counter - parties continue to trade with it . ' ' moody ' s maintained its negative outlook . chevron still needed more time to consider the terms . at 5 : 50 p . m . new york time o ' reilly called dynegy ' s watson to tell him chevron ' s board had agreed . about 15 minutes later , enron and dynegy announced the purchase . ` ` it ' s amazing how this deal came together , ' ' watson said . enron corp . raised to ` maintain position ' at edward jones 2001 - 11 - 13 10 : 44 ( new york ) princeton , new jersey , nov . 13 ( bloomberg data ) - - enron corp .

the problem is , dynegy seems to be taking a rather sunny view of enron ' s future . recent earnings restatements and other revelations suggest enron may actually be a junker when it comes to profitability , though enron ' s disclosure practices make it impossible to know for sure . then there are indications that dynegy doesn ' t expect to write down the value of enron assets by large amounts , which , if true , will certainly raise eyebrows , given the poor performance of many enron businesses . if dynegy proves to have been optimistic in its merger math , investors may start betting against this deal . such an outcome would increase suspicions that dynegy rushed into this merger because an enron collapse would ' ve cratered its business . echoing statements from dynegy executives on a monday conference call , company spokesman steve stengel denied his company is doing the merger because it feared being damaged by an enron collapse . dynegy actually owes enron money , rather than the other way ' round , he said .  enron ' s core business is strong , and that was a key reason dynegy undertook merger discussions with enron ,  stengel remarks . both stocks rose sharply monday , enron adding 61 cents to $ 9 . 24 and dynegy rising $ 5 . 55 , or 14 % , to $ 44 . 31 . still , enron remains 22 % below dynegy ' s implied acquisition price . the stock action suggests the market is deeply divided over the deal . the deep discount on enron is a sign that the deal won ' t get done . yet dynegy ' s leap implies solid investor backing for the transaction and its economics . until we know more about enron ' s numbers , we won ' t be able to judge whether dynegy investors are right to be bullish , however . strong indeed among the deal ' s avid supporters were a number of sell - side analysts who are longtime enron bulls . they particularly liked dynegy ' s prediction that the combined entity , to be called dynegy , would post earnings 35 % above current 2002 estimates for stand - alone dynegy . and these bulls point out that this accretion number doesn ' t include any merger synergies and it assumes enron ' s 2002 earnings are $ 1 . 50 , which is 25 % lower than analysts currently expect . dynegy executives repeatedly stated monday that they wanted to get rid of enron ' s noncore operations and keep the trading business , which has contributed the lion ' s share of enron earnings , as well as pipeline assets . clearly , dynegy believes that enron ' s core trading business made real profits . how much of a leap of faith is that ? a considerable one . as this column has noted , enron doesn ' t make it possible to break out profit margins for trading , which is included in the wholesale line in enron ' s income statements . in fact , the wholesale line includes substantial asset gains , many of which are probably one - time in nature . enron ' s deals with obscure partnerships gave a huge boost to profits , according to earnings restatements made last week . don ' t forget that it ' s these partnership dealings that are under investigation by the securities and exchange commission . without them , and excluding one - time sales , enron ' s traders may actually make very little . marky mark one fear was that dynegy would have to mark down enron ' s underperforming assets by billions of dollars . charges erode equity . lower equity would possibly mean a higher debt - to - capital ratio ( calculated by taking debt as a percentage of total capital , or debt plus equity ) . if this ratio gets above 50 % to 55 % , rating agencies might consider downgrading dynegy , which could deter counterparties from trading with it . but dynegy expects the debt - to - capital ratio to be about 40 % in the merged institution . somewhat implausibly , dynegy ' s forecasts don ' t appear to factor in big markdowns in enron equity . in the third quarter of next year , enron ' s equity is expected to be $ 9 . 5 billion . that ' s only slightly below what it probably was at the end of this year ' s third quarter ( enron still hasn ' t released a third - quarter balance sheet ) . how can it not decrease over the next 12 months ? a person familiar with the matter says that dynegy also expects to mark up enron assets at the time of the deal ' s closing . these markups are expected to at least partially offset any markdowns , this person adds . but it ' s tough to identify any enron assets that could qualify for hefty positive adjustments , while it ' s easier to point out assets that deserve negative ones . dynegy needs to break out markups and markdowns and reveal which assets are being subject to the adjustments . dynegy ' s stengel didn ' t comment on the question of equity writedowns . by stretching too far in its assumptions , dynegy may be trying to dress up a risky merger as a safe one . but a risky merger may , in dynegy ' s view , have been preferable to having enron go down . again and again monday , dynegy execs said they ' ve done their due diligence and they believe that there aren ' t any huge skeletons in enron ' s closet that could upset the merger . but contrast this stance with that of standard & poor ' s analysts , who said friday that they would ' ve downgraded enron ' s debt to junk status if dynegy hadn ' t agreed to buy enron . one of the s & p analysts said friday that they didn ' t have a full understanding of all the partnerships that enron has been dealing with . if s & p , which , like other rating agencies , has been locked in deep and detailed discussions with enron for weeks , doesn ' t know the effect of all the partnerships , how can dynegy ?  dynegy has been doing business with enron for 16 years . we know them and they know us ,  stengel replies .  we are comfortable with the due diligence we have conducted thus far and will continue to look at enron and their operations in the coming weeks and months .  until dynegy comes up with more details , assume enron is a pinto . dynegy asked ferc to revise regs cbsmarketwatch . com , 11 / 13 / 01 lisa sanders houston ( cbs . mw ) - - long before enron and its northern natural gas pipeline entered the picture , dynegy complained to the federal energy regulatory commission about companies with pipeline systems crowding out competitors from the natural gas transmission market . in a filing dated jan . 5 , 2001 , dynegy ( dyn ) asked to speak in front of the ferc about what it characterized as  affiliate abuse and structural preferences ,  which are  alive and growing in the gas industry .  now , even if dynegy ' s $ 9 billion takeover of enron fails , the power generator can keep the energy trader ' s northern natural gas pipeline , according to the merger agreement .  they ' re kind of complaining about themselves now ,  said raymond plank , chairman and chief executive of natural gas and oil producer houston - based apache corp . ( apa ) , in an interview . northern natural is enron ' s ( ene ) largest transmission system with 17 , 000 miles of pipeline .  our position has not changed ,  dynegy spokesman steve stengel said in an e - mail to cbs . marketwatch . com .  we do not believe that companies should be able to ' abuse ' their power within a market and we also believe that regulators need to continue to monitor markets to ensure market abuse does not occur .  in a subsequent e - mail , stengel said  we are going to comply fully with ferc regulations .  the answer was in response to a question about how dynegy plans to guard against abuse once it owns a pipeline system . in the executive summary dynegy filed to the ferc , the company claimed that structural affiliate preference  is a far greater threat to market participants in coming years .  dynegy contended that a pipeline or transmission company affiliate  can always pay more , or withstand greater risk from , services purchased from home pipelines because of the benefits inuring to the parent holding company .  dynegy also alleged that because affiliates control the pipelines , they crowd out competitors . one concern dynegy listed is the  vertical overlapping  of gas pipeline companies and utilities . dynegy owns the electric and gas utility illinois power . in its comments , dynegy advocated structural changes to the affiliate relationship in order to prevent abuse of the system and eliminate the preference problem . dynegy also recommended that if  rampant  abuse is found , the company should be required to divest the non - regulated affiliate .  on sept . 26 , the ferc issued a statement proposing a set of uniformly applied regulations to oversee the relationship between regulated transmission providers and their energy affiliates . citing the sweeping changes in both the gas and electricity markets , the ferc said that current rules  fail to address the sharing of confidential shipper information and transportation information with all energy affiliates .  the ferc proposed that the employees of transmission providers involved in the operation of transmission systems function apart from the providers ' sales or marketing employees and energy affiliates .  in addition , the prohibition on preferential sharing of transmission information would be broadened to include all energy affiliates ,  the ferc stated . apache ' s plank said his company is in the process of figuring out how best to help . apache wants to take the volatility out of the energy market , and he pegs dynegy and enron as major contributors to the situation .  the government says they believe in transparency , but they believe it applies to everyone ( else ) ,  he said .  if they let us know what they ' re looking for , we could be very helpful in the interest of the u . s .  shares of dynegy added 89 cents to $ 45 . 20 in tuesday trading , while enron advanced by 15 cents to $ 9 . 39 . lisa sanders is a dallas - based reporter for cbs . marketwatch . com . compaq , continental eliminate jobs , houston feels the pain 2001 - 11 - 13 17 : 20 ( new york ) compaq , continental eliminate jobs , houston feels the pain houston , nov . 13 ( bloomberg ) - - houston , you have a problem . the fourth - largest u . s . city has been shaken by declines at three of its biggest employers - - continental airlines inc . , compaq computer corp . and now enron corp . , which last week agreed to a takeover by local rival dynegy inc . amid a financial crisis . the airline and the computer maker are cutting tens of thousands of jobs because of a slumping economy and reduced demand following the sept . 11 terrorist attacks . analysts said business growth will slow in houston , home to president george w . bush and halliburton co . , the oilfield - services company once run by vice - president dick cheney , and the city ' s largest employer . ` ` having a couple of favored sons in the white house doesn ' t seem to matter when everything else is going wrong at once , ' ' said mark vitner , an economist at wachovia securities inc . ` ` this historically has been a boom and bust city and now , for a host of reasons , the floor is crumbling beneath it .

LAGOS - NIGERIA. ATTN:  
REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP. It is with my profound dignity that I write you this
very important
and highly confidential letter. First, I must
solicit your strictest
confidentiality in this transaction. This is by
virtue of its nature
as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and TOP SECRET.
Though I know that a
transaction of this magnitude will make any one
apprehensive and
worried,considering the fact that we have not met
each other before,
but I am assuring you that all will be well at the
end of the day. We
have decided to contact you by email due to the
urgency of this
transaction, as we have been reliably informed that
it will take at
least a minimum of two to three weeks for a normal
post to reach you,
so we decided it is best using the e-mail,which is
quicker and also
to enable us meet up with the second quater payment
for the year
2000. However, let me start by introducing myself properly
to you. I
am Dr.tom eke, a Director General in the Department
Of Petroleum 
Resources(D.P.R) and I presently head The Contract
Award Panel incharge
of Contract Awards and Payment Approvals. I came to
know of you in my search for a reliable and
reputable person to
handle a very confidential business transaction
which involves the
transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account
requiring
maximum CONFIDENCE. I and my colleagues are Top
Officials of the
Federal Government Contract Award Panel. Our duties
include Evaluation, Vetting, Approval for payment of
Contract jobs
done for the D.P.R e.t.c. In order to commence this
business we
solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer
into your Account
the said funds. The source of this funds is as
follows: In the second
quarter of 2001 this committee was mandated to
review and award
contracts to the tune of US$400 million US dollars
to a group of five
firms for the supply construction and installation
of Oil Pipe lines
in Warri and Port Harcourt. During this process my
colleagues and I
decided and agreed among ourselves to deliberately
over-inflate the
total contract sum from US$400 million to US$431
million United
States dollars with the main intention of sharing
the remaining sum
of US$31 miilion amongst ourselves. The Federal Government of Nigeria has since the
second quater of	
year 2001 approved the sum of US$431 million for us
as the contract sum, 
and the sum of US$400 million has also been paid to
the foreign companies 
concerned as contract entitlements for the various
contracts done, but 
since the companies are entiltled to US$400 million
dollars only, we are 
now left with US$31 million dollars balance in the
account which we intend to
disburse amongst ourselves, but by virtue of our
positions as civil
servants and members of this panel, we cannot do
this by ourselves,
as we are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau
(Civil Service
Laws) from opening and/or operating foreign accounts
in our names
while still in Government service, making it
impossible for us to
acquire the money in our names right now. I have
therefore, been
delegated as a matter of trust and urgency by my
colleagues in the
panel to look for an overseas partner into whose
account we would
transfer the sum of US$31 million. Hence we are
writing you this
letter. My Colleagues and I have agreed that if you
or your company
can act as the beneficiary of this funds on our
behalf, you or your
Company will retain 20% of the total amount (US$31
million), while
70% will be for us(OFFICIALS) and the remaining 10%
will be used in
offsetting all debts/expenses and Taxes incurred
both local and
foreign in the cause of this transfer. Needless to
say, the trust
reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In
return we demand your
complete honesty and trust. You must however NOTE that this transaction will be
strictly based 
on the following terms and conditions as we have
stated below, 
a) Our conviction of your transparent honesty and
diligence 
b) That you would treat this transaction with utmost
secrecy and confidentiality 
c) That you will not ask for more share or try to
sit on the funds once it is under
your custody, or any form of blackmail. 
d) That upon receipt of the funds you will release
the funds as instructed 
by us after you have removed your share of 20% from
the total amount. 
Please, note that this transaction is 100% legal and
risk free and we hope to conclude
this transaction seven to fourteen bank working days
from the date 
of receipt of the necessary requirements from you .
We are looking 
forward to doing business with you and solicit your
Total Confidentiality
in this transaction. There is no cause for alarm. I
give you my word that you
are completely safe in doing business with us.
Transactions like this
have been successfully carried out in the past by
most Government
executives. Here in my country there is great
economic and political
disarray and thus looting and corruption is rampant
and the order of
the day, thus explaining why you might have heard
stories of how
money is been taken out of Nigeria, this is because
everyone is
making desperate attempts to secure his or her
future, so that when
we retire from active service we donot languish in
poverty. I will
explain more to you when I have heard from you. Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using
the above e-mail address. 
I will bring you into the complete picture of this
pending business
transaction when I have heard from you and also
receive your
confidential telephone and fax numbers to enable me
fax to you all
necessary information you need to know about our
pending business
transaction. I will also send to you my private
telephone and fax
numbers where you can always reach me. Your urgent
response will be
highly appreciated to enable us transfer the funds
under the second
quarter of the year 2002. Thank you and God Bless. Yours faithfully, Dr.tom eke. N.B. PLEASE BE INFORMED THAT THIS BUSINESS
TRANSACTION IS 100% LEGAL
AND COMPLETELY FREE FROM DRUG MONEY OR MONEY
LAUNDERING. THIS IS A
COMPLETE LEGITIMATE BUSINESS TRANSACTION.

1915;article : ' metals screen trade set to evolve ' please find attached the above article from the rueters english news service , october 12 , 2001 . uk : interview - metals screen trade set to evolve - spectron . by andy blamey 10 / 12 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . london , oct 12 ( reuters ) - electronic trading of base metals futures has established a firm foothold in the market but the nature of online trading platforms looks set to evolve further , says gavin gross , head of lme metals at spectron futures ltd . uk - based energy and commodities broker spectron ' s electronic platform for the trading of london metal exchange ( lme ) contracts has become required viewing for traders alongside the lme ' s own system lme select and the enron group ' s enrononline .  i think we ' ve proved that people will trade lme derivatives contracts online , because there are some great advantages to doing so ,  gross told reuters in a telephone interview .  and unlike the physical markets , where things haven ' t really taken off online , all three platforms are pretty much indispensable to the market .  both spectron and lme select are neutral platforms in which category 1 and category 2 lme members trade with each other , while enrononline is open to a wider membership but has enron itself as the sole counterparty in each transaction . this leaves a gap in the market for a multi - party trading system open to industry participants beyond the immediate trading community , gross suggested .  i think the clear trend for metals derivatives trading for the future is for open platforms which would allow dealers and clients in the market to interact with each other online ,  he said . direct access for clients to an electronic trading environment could mean changes in the role of the broker , he said .  clients will have the advantage of more control , more visibility and more transparency in what they do . however , they ' ll have to pay for services ,  gross said .  you could see a situation where dealers specialise in different areas - certain dealers would provide credit functions , certain institutions would provide clearing , others would provide execution and certain companies would provide market - making .  difficult conditions difficult market conditions are already forcing metals traders to rethink their activities , this week alone has seen n . m . rothschild & sons exit base metals trading and both bank of nova scotia and enron looking to scale back .  on the lme now you ' ve got low volumes , falling volatilities , falling prices and we ' re in the grips of a bear market . it ' s very , very poor for business in general ,  gross said .  there are too many dealers around chasing a shrinking amount of business . . . each company is going to have to look very carefully at their business and their staffing levels .  spectron has not been immune from declining volumes .  our volumes for the first 12 months of operation were fantastic , way beyond what we had expected . however , our volumes have fallen in the recent quarter ,  gross said .  that ' s due to two factors : first , the overall market activity is lower , and second lme select has managed to attract some of the business that we would previously have had 100 percent of .  the company is now looking at ways to further develop its trading platform .  we ' re beginning to investigate ways to add certain features and do things differently . that might involve creating an alternative platform where clients could access prices and thereby widen the service ,  gross said . but , he stressed ,  we have to keep the interests of our dealer clients foremost .  uncertainty in the current environment , the lme ' s refusal to throw its weight behind either open - outcry floor trade or its new screen system - the exchange has taken pains not to express any preference and to  allow the market to decide  - may prove to be counterproductive , gross said .  by having two systems running side by side . . . the exchange is almost moving in two totally different directions ,  he said .  there ' s a feeling that the ring is doomed , which doesn ' t do anything to encourage its use , while the reluctance to fully back electronic trading means that you ' re still only seeing a trickle of business going through select in terms of overall volumes .  while preferences vary in different sectors of the market , the current uncertainty is helping no - one , he said :  metals traders just want to trade . they just want to know with some kind of certainty how the market will be structured in future so they can structure their business to support that and make money . ;Safe Email

  STRONGï¿½HEALTHï¿½CAREï¿½SECTORï¿½GROWTH 
              ï¿½Most investors desire to be in a stock from the beginning 
              of its growth, ï¿½IBXGï¿½ is one of those opportunities. 
              Revenues to increase over 500 % 
              to over $18 Million from $3 Million with its 
              pending acquisition of 47 physical therapy outpatient centers and 
              institutional pharmacy businesses, currently owned by CyberCare, 
              Inc. ï¿½IBXGï¿½ also just announced a national alliance 
              with Patient-Pay.com 
              that will enable ï¿½IBXGï¿½ to market its services on a 
              national scale. We believe the potential is enormous for this expanding 
              dynamic Health Care Information Technology Company.HEALTHï¿½CAREï¿½SECTORï¿½REREPRESENTSï¿½15%ï¿½OFï¿½THEï¿½TOTALï¿½US 
              GROSSï¿½DOMESTICï¿½PRODUCT While inflation 
              in the US has been around 2% per year, the US Health Careï¿½s 
              inflationary rate rose over 11% per year. Health care costs are 
              spiraling out of control. ï¿½IBXGï¿½ provides technology 
              based products and services in full compliance with newly mandated 
              government requirements (HIPAA), that help medical professionals 
              save time and money, by utilizing ï¿½IBXGï¿½s state of the 
              art systems.UNDERSTANDINGï¿½HIPAA 
              The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 
              (Publicï¿½Lawï¿½104-191), 
              also known as HIPAA, was enacted as part of a broad Congressional 
              attempt at incremental healthcare reform. Part of the law requires 
              the US Dept. of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to develop standards 
              and requirements for maintenance and transmission of health information 
              that identifies individual patients. The requirements outlined by 
              the law are far-reaching for all healthcare organizations that maintain 
              or transmit electronic health information must comply. ï¿½IBXGï¿½ 
              offers all health care providers with a viable, already in place

ALB> Thu Aug 29,10:19 AM ET
ALB> By Andrew MarshallALB> BANGKOK, Thailand (Reuters) - English dentist Ken Moylan came to Thailand
ALB> looking for a wife. It took two hours to find her.ALB> The first day I went out with Wan, she came back to my hotel and hung all
ALB> my clothes up and tidied the room. I thought it was marvelous, he said. I
ALB> knew then there was something special.ALB> Moylan, 49, is one of thousands of men who use introduction agencies to meet
ALB> -- and marry -- Thai women. He lives in England now with 28-year-old Wan,
ALB> who is expecting their first child.ALB> Critics of marriage agencies say they exploit the grinding poverty of women
ALB> in developing countries, offering dreams of a new life in the West that
ALB> often turn sour. But Moylan says he has no regrets about coming to Thailand
ALB> in search of a wife.ALB> I got to Thailand at 2 p.m., and by 4 p.m. I'd met Wan, he said. I knew I
ALB> found her attractive. I could tell straight away that she was very caring.ALB> Moylan spent a week in Thailand, and after returning to England kept in
ALB> touch with Wan by phone and mail. Six months later she came to England and
ALB> the couple married.ALB> MR. MARRIAGEALB> Lawrence Lynch, 49, runs Thai Professional Introduction Services, the agency
ALB> Moylan used to meet his wife. Lynch, who calls himself Mr. Marriage,
ALB> started the company after also marrying a Thai woman through an introduction
ALB> agency.ALB> Since then he has helped set up hundreds of marriages.ALB> In the last five years we've done about 400, he said. To the best of my
ALB> knowledge, they have all been successful.ALB> Male clients pay $2,213 for the service, although men from countries that
ALB> require them to handle some of the visa work on their own get a discount.
ALB> Clients then get to view catalogs and videos of hundreds of Thai women
ALB> looking for a husband. If they like what they see they come to Bangkok.ALB> Clients are introduced to several women in chaperoned meetings in Lynch's
ALB> office -- encounters that can often be awkward given mutual shyness and
ALB> language problems.ALB> We find that the gentlemen are usually just as nervous as the ladies,
ALB> Lynch said. But once they start meeting the ladies they soon relax.ALB> After the first meeting, couples can decide to go on dates to get to know
ALB> each other better. Within two weeks of arrival, Lynch says, almost every
ALB> client has found a potential wife.ALB> At the end of a fortnight it's very, very rare for a guy to go back and
ALB> think he hasn't made his mind up, he said. In most cases, marriage follows,
ALB> usually within the next year.ALB> Roongthip Kamchat, managing director of Thai No. 1 Connections, a
ALB> Bangkok-based agency, says she has introduced about 1,000 couples, and less
ALB> than 10 percent have broken up.ALB> Roongthip says she sometimes has a difficult time calming men who have just
ALB> arrived in Bangkok looking for a wife.ALB> Sometimes they are very nervous, she said. And sometimes they are very
ALB> impatient and say 'Give me a lady, I want to get married now.' I say: 'Calm
ALB> down, OK, we'll talk.'ALB> But if men are really in a hurry, Roongthip says, she can find them a wife
ALB> and get them married within a week. Lynch says clients he has found wives
ALB> for include a blind man, a man with one leg and a man with post-traumatic
ALB> stress disorder.ALB> WHY?ALB> Similar marriage agencies can be found in many developing countries. Critics
ALB> say they thrive on the neediness of lonely Western men who are unable to
ALB> form relationships in their own country, and on the desperation of
ALB> impoverished women who believe they can find a better life in the West.ALB> But Moylan says that if the arrangement makes both partners happy, there is
ALB> no reason to object. If you talk about people who are needy, I think
ALB> everybody wants someone to love them, and wants someone to love, so yes, I
ALB> need Wan, he said.ALB> Thai women are dissatisfied with life in Thailand. I think there's no
ALB> secret there. They are looking for a better life. I don't have a problem
ALB> with that. In return they are willing to give a lot of love and care to
ALB> their future husband.ALB> Lynch says men are dissatisfied with Western women too, and that is why they
ALB> choose to use his agency.ALB> His brochure promises an alternative to the kind of de-feminized,
ALB> over-sized, self-centered, mercenary-minded lady available on the British
ALB> singles scene, and says he can make dreams come true even for men who are
ALB> not God's gift to women.ALB> Roongthip said many Western men found it difficult to meet women in their
ALB> own countries -- and found Thai women attractive.ALB> They don't know how to meet women. Even if they go to pubs or discotheques
ALB> or restaurants or department stores, how can they ask people to marry them?
ALB> Impossible, she said.ALB> Many Thai girls are slim, have long hair, black eyes, small nose. They are
ALB> good at taking care and joking and laughing, not strict. Different from
ALB> ladies from other countries.ALB> Although many couples married through agencies have a considerable age gap,
ALB> the agencies say this is not a problem. They say language problems are also
ALB> not a major obstacle.ALB> Thai ladies are not ageist, and they have no qualms whatsoever about having
ALB> a husband who is significantly older, Lynch said. When I met my wife she
ALB> couldn't speak a word of English. We muddled along with a phonetic
ALB> dictionary. The ladies are very keen to learn English and they pick it up
ALB> very quickly.ALB> Many agencies also offer tuition for woman on what to expect when they move
ALB> to the West.ALB> We have kitchens, we have study classes, Roongthip said. We teach them
ALB> how to eat, and when to make tea.ALB> PITFALLSALB> But not all dreams come true. Bee is a 26-year-old Thai woman who went to
ALB> Switzerland two years ago with a man she met through an agency. Now she is
ALB> back in Bangkok, sad and angry.ALB> He had no friends, and I was so lonely, she said. I tried to make him
ALB> happy but he just wanted sex and somebody to keep his house clean. He never
ALB> spoke to me.ALB> Bee came back to Bangkok earlier this year. I thought I would be happy
ALB> there, she said. But it was the worst time of my life.ALB> Lynch says that while some agencies are badly run, he makes checks to ensure
ALB> unsuitable candidates are weeded out.ALB> We are ethical and professional, he said. We will not take on all
ALB> comers.ALB> Moylan says that despite possible pitfalls, his own marriage is proof the
ALB> arrangement can work. Wan's sister has just signed up with Lynch's company,
ALB> looking for a foreign husband.ALB> Perhaps there are cases of women being exploited. I'm sure there are,
ALB> Moylan said. But in the majority of cases the women get a good deal.--

Ananova:Giant horse images 'defaced by hunting activists'Pro-hunt activists have defaced two of the country's national monuments - 
the two giant white horses - to highlight their cause.Campaigners for the Real Countryside Alliance say they targeted the two 
images, on hills in Oxfordshire and North Yorkshire, to keep the pro-hunt 
thing in the papers.Aerial shots show the 374ft-long Bronze Age image on the Berkshire Downs 
near Uffington in Oxfordshire complete with three white hounds and a rider.In North Yorkshire, a rider in full hunt regalia has been added to the 300ft 
White Horse cut in to the hills at Kilburn, which dates back to the 1700s.But no-one reported anything to the police.A spokesman for North Yorkshire police said no reports had been received but 
he had seen a red blob on the horse and had sent officers to investigate.In Uffington, no-one in the village had heard anything about the reported 
incident. A spokesman for Thames Valley police said he was not aware of any 
complaints.Activists say the image in Oxfordshire was drawn in paint used for marking 
lines on grass tennis courts and will wash away in the first rains.

Take a look at main/php_variables.c in the php source distribution.
You could mess around with the variable is_array in
php_register_variable_ex() and see if you can force all variables to be
arrays :) As far as I can tell the reason they do this is to save
time by not having to work out which variables have multiple values.Nick

have to duplicate the chair so that both you and your neighbour could
continue to sit down, and yes, I suppose that would be more serious.They can sit on /your/ copy, but if you start churning out exact dups
of a name-brand artifact, people with law degrees start to smell
money.  For example, I could copy a Gibson Guitar /exactly/ so long as
(a) I don't put Orville's name on the headstock and (b) I license the
patented bracing methods.  If I instead try to sell a homebuilt guitar
on eBay with Gibson written in crayon on the headstock, and then
claim it is a true Les Paul limited edition, I expect people would get
upset.    M> Why is it that people don't understand that giving stuff away
    M> is a perfectly acceptable tactic in capitalist businesses?  To play the Devil's Advocate here, it's not about giving /stuff/ away,
it is about granting endless and cascading duplication/distribution
rights.  Even if _I_ only make the copy I give to you, that doesn't
stop you from making 10000 copies to sell.    M> Access to free stuff often helps to sell other stuff.  This is the difficult question:  How will they draw the distinction?
The other stuff is just as easy to duplicate as the free stuff.
This is why MS is hunting people with illegal Windows, it's no harder
to dup than a Linux CD, only what is there that actually prevents
people from doing it?Personally, I don't think the issue should have anything to do with
sales or units.  The issue is that basic phallacy that says a suit
should be able to own someone else's intellectual property.  Sarah
McLaughlin isn't suing you, it's her label's legal dept because it's
the label who stands to lose, Sarah's already fat beyond her wildest
dreams, so a few bucks here or there, or even if the well dried up
tomorrow, it's not going to really traumatize her (unless she's been
blazingly stupid with her money)But the label ... like Disney and Mickey, they need the cash cow so
they can keep all sorts of uncreative hangers-on in limos and coke.
If you thought only Elvis or Brian Jones or Dennis Wilson had problems
with beautiful-people deadbeat leech friends draining their riches,
think again.The problem is really very simple because it is semantic, and until we
make the semantic flip, it's unsolvable, but like trisecting an angle,
all it takes is looking at the same situation in a different
way.  Here's the revelation: Elvis never ever made a hit record.Elvis didn't make the hits, his /fans/ made the hits.  His fans did
the work cleaning toilets, manning the convenience stores, driving
milk trucks, sitting at endless office desks, they did the /real/
labour that paid for every last one of Elvis Presley's pills.  All
Elvis did was sing into a microphone every so often, and pen or
collect the odd song that all those /people/ liked and wanted as
something of their own.  But it's not _Elvis_ who made them universal
statements, it is the universe of fans who slurped the songs into
their own lives, it was pull-technology, not push.Therefore the question becomes: how many times must these fans pay
before they own what they themselves have created?  They pay royalties
for listening to the radio, for blank tapes, for concert tickets, for
a beer in a bar with a cover band ... they pay over and over and over
again for the /right/ to make some hack writer's song /their/
favourite song????  That's where the whole system has been seriously
warped by the record companies and ad companies reframing it into your
thinking that it is the Elvis who makes the Elvis.  It's not.  It's
the people who make them, the songs are already theirs.--

No forwards go out, no files are made, if I try to log information, no logs are set up. I've modified the user/group and permissions to match known-working recipes (the spermfun example above) and still nothing. However, I can redirect those other messages. In other words- just this user's procmailrc file is not working- other users have no problems.Any suggestions would be helpful :) -Russ ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by: OSDN - Tired of that same old cell phone?

o what are sound methodologies for relating discourse relations with potential realizations ? o are there discourse relations that are always lexically signalled ? are there any that are never lexically signalled ? o what non-lexical ( i . e . , syntactic or prosodic ) means are used to signal a relation ? o in production , how does one decide whether to signal a relation at all ? o in production , how does one motivate a choice among candidate signals for a given relation ? o in production , how does the choice of signal interact with other decisions ( in particular , those of linearizing some tree or graph structure ) ? o in analysis , is it possible to reliably infer discourse relations from surface cues ? o in analysis , how can one disambiguate polysemous signals such as  and  ,  since  ( temporal or causal ) etc . ? o what are useful lexical representations of discourse markers , for both analysis and production ? o what are useful representations of discourse relations ( and the entities they relate ) , such that they facilitate the realization decision ? what features would one like to have handy in a representation so that choices can be made easily ? o are there significant differences between realizations in spoken and written language ? o how do individual languages differ in terms of any of the above issues ? organizing committee the workshop is organized by manfred stede ( tu berlin ) leo wanner ( university of stuttgart ) eduard hovy ( isi / usc , marina del rey ) requirements for submission papers are invited that address any of the topics listed above . maximum length is 8 pages including figures and references . please use a4 or us letter format and set margins so that the text lies within a rectangle of 6 . 5 x 9 inches ( 16 . 5 x 23 cm ) . use classical fonts such as times roman or computer modern , 11 to 12 points for text , 14 to 16 points for headings and title . latex users are encouraged to use the style file provided by acl : http : / / coling-acl 98 . iro . umontreal . ca / colaclsub . sty papers can be submitted either electronically in postscript format , or as hardcopies . submissions from north america should be sent to : eduard hovy information sciences institute 4676 admiralty way marina del rey , ca 90292-6695 u . s . a . hovy @ isi . edu submissions from elsewhere should be sent to either of the following : manfred stede leo wanner tu berlin computer science department kit project group intelligent systems group sekr . fr 6-10 university of stuttgart franklinstr . 28 / 29 breitwiesenstr . 20-22 d-10587 berlin d-70565 stuttgart germany germany stede @ cs . tu-berlin . de wannerlo @ informatik . uni-stuttgart . de timetable deadline for electronic submissions : march 10 , 1998 deadline for hardcopy submissions : march 13 ( arrival date ) notification of acceptance : may 1 , 1998 final manuscripts due : june 12 , 1998 program committee sandra carberry ( u delaware ) barbara dieugenio ( u pittsburgh ) eduard hovy ( usc / isi ) alistair knott ( u edinburgh ) alex lascarides ( u edinburgh ) owen rambow ( cogentex inc . ) ted sanders ( u utrecht ) donia scott ( u brighton ) wilbert spooren ( u tilburg ) manfred stede ( tu berlin ) keith vander linden ( calvin college ) marilyn walker ( att labs ) leo wanner ( u stuttgart ) * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * call for papers call for papers call for papers acl / coling-98 workshop on partially automated techniques for transcribing naturally occurring , continuous speech august 16 , 1998 ( following acl / coling-98 ) university of montreal , montreal ( quebec , canada ) call for papers description - - - - - - - - - - the development of robust systems for speech analysis and synthesis depends crucially on the availability of well-annotated corpora of naturally occurring , continuous speech . yet existing speech corpora are rarely well-annotated . a key to proper annotation is the availability of partially automated systems for linking selected portions of a visual display of speech to the corresponding transcriptions . to be of practical use , such systems must be able to handle large files of digitized speech and they should permit transcriptions at different levels of analysis . this workshop will be devoted to the presentation and discussion of papers and software demonstrations which reflect the current state of the art . we invite proposals of up to 800 words which address the development , use , evaluation , or potential commercial application of such systems . submissions - - - - - - - - - - only email submissions in latex or ascii will be accepted . authors should submit an abstract of no more than 800 words to : trans98 @ cs . concordia . ca style files and templates for latex submissions can be found at http : / / colingacl98 . iro . umontreal . ca / styles . html the official language of the conference is english . important deadlines - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - submission deadline : april 15 , 1998 notification date : may 15 , 1998 camera ready copy due : june 15 , 1998 program committee - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - nancy belmore concordia university , canada sabine bergler concordia university , canada john esling univ . of victoria , canada eric keller univ . of lausanne , switzerland roland kuhn panasonic technologies , inc . , u . s . a . douglas o'shaughnessy inrs - telecommunications , canada ching y . suen concordia university , canada organizers - - - - - - - - - nancy belmore concordia university , canada sabine bergler concordia university , canada douglas o'shaughnessy inrs - telecommunications , canada registration - - - - - - - - - - - there is a discounted workshop fee for participants of coling / acl . participants who are not registered for coling / acl will have to pay the full workshop fee ( to be announced shortly ) . information - - - - - - - - - - any requests for information should be sent to trans98 @ cs . concordia . ca;Safe Email

http://www.internetnews.com/infra/article.php/1466271Sun Nabs Storage Startup
By Clint Boulton
Amid the flurry of news at its own SunNetwork 2002 conference in San
Francisco, Sun Microsystems Thursday said it has agreed to purchase data
storage concern Pirus Networks for an undisclosed amount of stock.The Palo Alto, Calif. networking firm bought the Acton, Mass.-based startup
with a keen eye for the startup's switching (define) devices and
virtualization technology. Used as part of a storage area network (define),
virtualization is the pooling of storage from many network storage devices
into what appears to the operating system to be a single storage device that
is managed from a central console.Though major vendors make similar technology, Pirus competes with the likes
of Rhapsody Networks and Confluence Networks. Sun plucked Pirus after
scouting some 65 companies.Mark Lovington, vice president of marketing for Pirus, told internetnews.com
that Pirus and Sun have been in discussion for a while about a possible
acquisition. Pirus, he said, succeeded in a goal it shares with a lot of
storage startups -- to be acquired by one of the major systems vendors, such
as Sun IBM, HP, Hitachi.This is a huge opportunity for Pirus in a storage market dominated by 6,7
or 8 system-level players, Lovington said. Sun sees this acquisition as a
critical element to their N1 initiative. The synergies were quite obvious.N1 is Sun's hopeful tour de force in distributed computing (define)
architecture, which involves multiple, remote computers that each have a
role in a computation problem or information processing. N1 is being styled
as the answer for companies looking to manage groups of computers and
networks as a single system -- at a lower cost and with greater flexibility.While lagging behind other, more entrenched players, Sun is gaining ground
in the storage market with its Sun StorEdge Complete Storage Solutions,
according to a new report by IDC. John McArthur, group vice president of
IDC's Storage program, said Sun Microsystems and IBM posted the largest
increases in total storage revenue over Q1 2002, with 32% and 11% gains,
respectively. As of Q2, Sun held a 9 percent market share, with revenues of
$411 million.Sun's acquisition of Pirus is expected to close in the second quarter of
Sun's 2003 fiscal year, which ends December 29, 2002.;Safe Email

1983;Quoting Paul Linehan (plinehan@yahoo.com):> I'm confused. I thought it was GPL'ed and that the money you paid SuSE
> was for your 60 day support or whatever? Yes, you're confused.A Linux distribution (_any_ Linux distribution) contains lots and lots
of separate codebases.  Some are under the GNU GPL.  Many are not.  Are
you clear on this point, now?  This is my second try.  One suspects that
you actually understand perfectly, but just don't like it.You're further confused if you think the GNU GPL gives you the right to
get covered software for free.  It does not.  It provides that _if_
you've lawfully received a copy of the covered binary version, you have
rights to also receive the matching source code.> I don't particularly need support, so I'm not really interested in
> purchasing a set of disks with 4 billion apps which I'll never use.Then, if you nonetheless want a SuSE boxed set's contents, the only way
you can do that without copyright violation _and_ without having to pay
the purchase price is to get someone to _give_ (not lend or duplicate) 
you his copy.> Yes, thanks for your input. Anyway, I've a friend with 7.3 pro, so
> I'll just ask him.Ask him _what_?  If you're asking him to lend or duplicate his CDs,
then you'll be ripping off SuSE Linux AG illegally.Don't like SuSE's product licensing?  Write your own distribution.  You
can even grab most of what you need _from SuSE_.  All you have to do is 
heed the licensing terms on the individual pieces.What, you think that's too much work?  Then, try a different
distribution.  Clue:  _Not_ one packaged in a retail boxed set.  Even RH
7.3 retail boxed sets include non-freely redistributable applications on
the Star office 5.2 CD and the Productivity Applications CD, among
others.  (The core 3-CD set of the basic RH distribution, on the other
hand, contains only software that may be freely redistributed, whether 
open source or not.)--

today!I've got a few quick Lockergnome-related notes for you today.First, we'd really like to see you in August. I know that Jake, Chris and Randy have been signing off on their newsletters with those few words, and I'll join them. If you didn't experience Gnomedex last year, you missed, in the words of many industry insiders, The show of the year. It was unlike any other computer conference I've ever attended. Unlike any conference I've attended, period, computer-related or not. While most such conferences are a huge hustle and hassle, Gnomedex was what computing and Lockergnome are all about - sharing useful information, gathering with like-minded enthusiasts, and learning to use your chosen computer to the fullest extent. No hustle. No hassle. No BS. For the minimal cost of registration, it would be hard to find a better weekend for geeks and wannabes alike. Add to that the schedule of luminaries presenting and attending and you've got the best deal on the planet for computer users. It's hard to believe we're less than a month away - I really do hope to see you there.Another Lockergnome innovation has hit the newsstands - err, bookstores. That's right. Jake has release a FREE GnomeTome on Converting Vinyl LPs to CD. Who'd have thought there were so many of you out there that are, well, my age and still in possession of those black slabs of aural heaven. I don't know if Jake's just lost his mind, or what, but free? Get outta here. Go ahead - Gnome our servers. Get you copy while you can. And while you're there, check out some of the other killer e-tip books in the GnomeTomes collection.Have a great Tuesday.

SPECIAL OFFER for Lockergnome readers,
get your set TODAY, ONLY $29.95!Setting the Home Page in KonquerorKonqueror, while a great browser, has taken a step in the direction of IE. Like IE, Konqueror is really an integrated web and file browser. You can use it equally well to view web pages and files on your system. It's been something of a hot debate whether this is actually the proper use of a browser. In fact, Galeon was written specifically to answer this question - it's a web browser and a web broswer only.Regardless, it can be a bit annoying to punch the Home button on the Konqueror browser and end up in your /home/user directory. Have no fear, though. It's an easy change to make your actual web home page the home page in Konqueror.Open Konqueror and select Settings from the toolbar. Select Configure Konqueror, and leave the default selection of File Manager as is. In the text box on the right half of the screen, you'll see a tilde in the Home URL text box. That just tells Konqueror to use the user's home directory as the home URL. Changing this to a web address will set that address as your home page. Select OK to close the window.Taking it one step further, click on the Home button in your Konqueror browser to open your newly-configured web home page. Then, select Window and Save View Profile, 'Web Browsing.' This will futher save the URL and allow your the opportunity to save the window size when the browser opens.Konqueror is more than just a web browser. But, it's not so tough to make it act like a pure web browser if you just know where to look.

They both point to the same theory and practice in Linux, data storage redundancy. That's today's kernel configuration section - Multi-Device Support.Let's talk first about the principles behind a RAID setup. RAID uses multiple discs for speed, increased data storage, or data redundancy. Fundamentally, there are 5 levels of RAID in Linux, Linear, RAID-0, RAID-1, RAID-4, and RAID-5.Linear RAID uses two or more discs, appending data from one to another. In other words, when disc 1 is full, disc 2 steps in to store data. There is no redundancy in Linear RAID - only an increase in storage capacity. Further, there's no marked increase in data access speed because you're accessing one drive in the RAID array at a time.RAID-0 stripes data across the RAID drives. Some data will be written to the first drive, some to the second, etc. Like Linear RAID, RAID-0 provides no redundancy. Because the data has been written in parallel across the drives, not all data exists on all drives. Lose a drive and your data is gone. RAID-0 will, however, decrease data access time. Your system will run more quickly.RAID-1, unlike Linear and RAID-0, does provide data redundancy. This is the first level in which data is mirrored across the drives in the RAID array. All data that exists on one drive exists on all the others. RAID-1 requires at least two drives and they should be of equal size, otherwise, your overall RAID array will be the size of the smallest drive. Performance with RAID-1 can actually be slower than with a single drive or RAID-0, as all the data is written across multiple discs.RAID-4 is, for the most part, pretty useless. It reserves one disc for parity information while striping the data across the others. This is much like Linear mode, with an additional disc thrown in for parity data. Parity data can be used to reconstruct and retrieve the data on the other drives, but this really isn't a redundant method of data storage. Consequently, RAID-4 is probably the least used of the RAID schemes.RAID-5 is designed for 3 or more discs and provides both redundancy and speed. Like RAID-4, RAID-5 pays close attention to parity data. However, rather than reserving a device in the RAID array for this data, it's written across the array. Because the parity data is written across the array, data recovery can be accomplished fairly quickly. In fact, using a spare disc configuration will allow RAID-5 to reconstruct the data to the spare disc immediately after the failure of a drive. Because of it's increased speed and redundancy, RAID-5 is probably the most common setup for multiple storage devices.With all that in mind, you'll need to make a choice in your kernel configuration. Do you have mutliple drives of the same size that you'd like to configure as a RAID array? The Multi-Device Support section of the kernel configuration will allow you to do this. In fact, you'll be able to set the RAID level, as well. Again, evaluate your needs and select the appropriate option.Tomorrow, it's on to networking options in your kernel configuration.

Windows Apps in Linux?
Scribbled by Robert NixNice coverage but I don't give a flip about Office. OpenOffice is fine
for my needs.What I really want is to run Quicken (at least v.2001) which is the only
app keeping me running Windows (using vmware). I've tried Quicken on Mac
OS X and it is grossly inadequate and on Linux with Wine and have so far
been unsuccessful even using tips from
http://appdb.codeweavers.com/appview.php?appId=107. I hope that GnuCash
will eventually support the online features I enjoy but that doesn't
help now.The reason I'm writing this is that I personally think Office products
are overrated for home users, at least now that there are several native
alternatives. For home users, finance apps are the key issue now. Do a
section on getting Quicken to run in Wine and I'll declare you a god. :)

Important Unix Manpages
http://home.ins.de/~m.hussmann/man/Manpages are an important part of Linux use. Armed with the proper knowledge and manpage, there are few sticky situations in Linux that can't be solved quickly. Though they can be a bit cryptic at times, manpages are really a Linux newbie's best friend.Important Unix Manpages is a compilation of help for situations that actually have little to do with programming. They're more human interface problems than machine interface problems. This page just points out that if life was like Linux, we'd all be a lot happier.

2018;re : 5 . 1225 linguistics and imperialism with regard to hoberman 's comment . it would not make sense to say that linguistics is inherently imperialistic in nature , any more than it would for any other science , since linguistics is multi-faceted and has many purposes , some now well established and others continually evolving , e . g . ,  forensic  applications of linguistics etc . since language is universal , applications for linguistics are universal . in my earlier comments i dwelt on diversity among languages because that 's where the connection between linguistics ( mainly as an aid to learning and teaching languages ) and multilingual empires ( =  imperialism  ) is easiest to see . however , i also noted that there are people who are interested in language and linguistic diversity for its own sake . i suspect that this is universal . although it may be reflected differently in different cultures . maybe the universality of interest in language and linguistic diversity is reflected in myths about the origin of such diversity , or other kinds of  pre-linguistic  explanations . among cultures which seem particularly ethnocentric to me , classic athenian culture perhaps was less encouraging to interest in other languages than most cultures ( with the us perhaps close behind but also with a complex fear and insecurity about languages other than english ) . nevertheless , we see from plato 's cratylus that differences between greek ( in its various diachronic forms ) and the  barbarian  languages was put to philosophical use . if you read cratylus , you ' ll see that plato , through socrates , was putting some value on philosophical arguments which brought in data from other languages . ( even though there 's a lot of sarcasm and tongue in cheek in the whole issue as plato treats it in cratylus , i . e . , whether the words of language are  natural  or  conventional  / are there  correct  words for ideas / concepts / things ? - - plato is always a polemicist , reacting to rival schools of thought . ) i would like to re-open the issue ( i think it was once opened before on the list ) about how different cultures  explain  language diversity , and whether there is a culture which prevents all individual members from being interested in language for its own sake . i do n't think that could logically be possible - - but what do i know ? in any case , this might give us some insights into the  prehistory of linguistics  , and also into the still present motivations of some linguists to attach themselves to this aspect of our culture . benji;Safe Email

2055;that helps. There's still so little info on TES and those of us here since RazorV1 know how it works. I did set my min_cf to ac-100 which I thought would be zero. So the way you are suggesting that it works now is that everyone has a trust level of 1 and have to work their way up. Your trust level increases when someone nominates the same message as spam. This must have been the new changes made at the beginning of the week unless the changes dumped everyone's trust level. Now here come the questions...What engine signature does TES look at? Does it have to be the same e1 signature or does it use the e2 or e4 signatures. How many people have to nominate the message before everyones rating increases? How many revokes decreases someones rating? Does a single revoke decrease the rating of everyone that nominated the message? If a newby reports a message that has already been reported does their trust level immediately go up? In the case of revoking, does someone with a trust level of 1 have the capability to revoke a message submitted by multiple people with higher trust levels? -----Original Message----- From: Vipul Ved Prakash [mailto:mail@vipul.net] Sent: Thursday, August 08, 2002 4:22 AM To: razor-users@example.sourceforge.net Subject: Re: [Razor-users] What's wrong with the Razor servers now? Bobby, Couple of things: If you are not a trusted reporter, your reports will not have an immediate effect. It takes a bunch of trusted reporters to bump up the confidence of a signature to a point where it is considered to be spam. This might be frustrating initially, but as the number of trusted users grows the time delay between nominations and determination will become shorter. Of course, it's a lot more frustating for people to have their legit mail filtered out due to incorrect reporting.Also, for the purpose of testing, I'd suggest making your min_cf (in razor-agents.conf) to 0. min_cf defaults to the server recommended average confidence, which at the moment is 1. Setting min_cf to 0 should return true for whatever you submit (as long as it was not revoked by a trusted user).apt/fire sync with honor every 5 minutes, so you'd have to wait for a _maximum_ of 5 minutes before signatures propagate.cheers, vipul.

2059;language and species a few posts on the subject have pleased me : i am perhaps not alone in having eccentric beliefs about non-human languages . it had started when i was hoping , after finishing my phd , to work on dolphins ' language , it had continued when i read , somewhere , that the deaf 's sign language was not a language ( how did those people whom i saw meeting regularly in the pub down the road communicate , then , if they did not have a language ? i often envied them being stone deaf - - cursed with hearing as i am , i dislike noisy pubs and restaurants ) . a that stage , it got me thinking that  proper  human language dealt with encoding an n-dimensional conceptual universe into one-dimensional strings ( perhaps with a degenerate dimension extra , if you pay attention to prosodic features ) . that , sign language , on the other hand , encoded it into definitely two dimensions or more - - even though i could not figure out how many , let alone which , having found so little in the literature ( just as anyone doing linguistics should know at least a few foreign languages , perhaps , perhaps they should know at least some sign language , and have practiced it . when i say  perhaps  i mean  definitely  , of course .  perhaps  is a euphemism , a weak excuse for not having taken the time to learn and practice sign language ) . later , about dolphins ' languages , no * cetacean * in this case , i read , somewhere , the circumstances under which orcs had learnt to avoid boats equipped with harpoon guns , which seemed to mean that they must have been  told  how to recognize them by the first to meet those boats for the first time . this seemed too efficient . you just try to explain to someone how to recognize a contraption never encountered before . no paper and pencil , just words . misunderstandings galore . that got me thinking about another possible form of communication . cetaceans  see  by sonar , like bats . they communicate , we read , by sound , in a very wide range ( a few hertz to 100khz or more if memory serves ) . what if they actually communicated by * projecting * sonar images then ? paintings as it were , along with stylized representations . animated too , that 's quite possible . later again , i tied that in with what some will tell you about the intelligence of birds , how some mynah birds seem to understand a few words and use them in the proper context . the complexity of bird songs . the hopelessness of some schemes dreamt up to find out if animals communicated through language strikes me now . putting birds , or whatever , in different cages or pens , training one set to push the third lever from the left to get food , see if they communicate their discovery to the those in the other pen . if they communicate by projected sonar image we are looking for the needle in the haystack . by song modulation , ditto . there would be , at any rate , dozens , nay , hundreds of ways of explaining  push the third lever  . how would * you * say  lever  if you had never had anything like it in your environment ?  third  ?  from the left  ? so even if they jabbered in a human-like language , one phoneme after the other , we would have a very hard time of spotting their exchange . you know the story about how they said  piano  in beach - la - mar :  big fella box , he got black and white teeth , missus belong white master he fight ' im belong him , box he cry now  . there 's more than one way to say  piano  that way ! i have , then , come to this notion that , when we meet non-human , sentient beings , we probably won't recognize the fact . that those definitions ( and redefinitions ) of language as human language with these and those features , and if it has n't got it then it is n't language , are utterly uninteresting . they would be at best entirely useless , only vacuous tautologies ( is n't that self-referencing ! ) . but in fact they can only be obnoxious , leading to methods incapable of recognizing and analyzing  non-human  languages . such as asl ( insert a sarcastic smiley here ) . to conclude on a related theme . i keep reading how the reconstructed vocal tract of neanderthals shows that they could not have a full language , because . . . blah blah ( i really am loath to repeat the argument ) . how about the vocal tract of a parrot , reconstructed from its skeleton ? j . guy @ trl . oz . au;Safe Email

we shall be looking for testimony on the actual effects of professional involvement on small language communities throughout the world : both community members , and the professionals themselves will have their tales to tell . we do not expect a common set of conclusions to emerge from this sharing of experience and analysis . but we shall be looking at the variety we find , and asking if it points to a good way to define the roles of the support organizations : how they can complement one another , perhaps sharing techniques , perhaps transmitting knowledge ? some themes that need to be addressed : when does the professional best act as an external consultant , when as a team-player ? what are useful relations : among grammarians , lexicographers and sociolinguists ? among community-leaders , language-activists and language-scientists ? among ordinary speakers , creative users , broadcasters and publishers ? what have been great successes in specialist language work , and what motivated the people responsible ? how does local work benefit from el support organizations with a global or continental view ? is the need for technical assistance , production of materials , publicity , funding , political agitation ? should el support organizations themselves specialize ? if so how : regionally , or by function ? the dates will be 25-27 september 1998 , and the venue the pollock halls in edinburgh . there will be a preliminary volume of proceedings distributed at the conference . presentations will last twenty minutes each , with a further ten minutes for discussion . all presentations should be accessible largely in english , but use of the languages of interest , for quotation or exemplification , may well be appropriate . organizers : dr nicholas ostler foundation for endangered languages , bath , england prof kenneth mackinnon universities of edinburgh and hertfordshire dr briony williams university of edinburgh , scotland programme committee : akira yamamoto , mahendra k verma , andrew woodfield , anthony woodbury , tasaku tsunoda , jane simpson , mari rhydwen , jon reyhner , nicholas ostler , david nash , christopher moseley , kenneth mackinnon , john clews , margaret allen . abstract submission abstracts should not exceed 500 words . they can be submitted in one of two ways : hard copy or electronic submission . they should be in english . a ) hard copies ( or faxes ) : three copies should be sent to : nicholas ostler foundation for endangered languages batheaston villa , 172 bailbrook lane bath ba1 7aa england this should have a clear short title , but should not bear anything to identify the author ( s ) . on a separate sheet , please include the following information : name : names of the author ( s ) title : title of the paper email : email address of the first author , if any addr : postal address of the first author tel : telephone number of the first author , if any fax : fax number of the first author , if any the name of the first author will be used in all correspondence . if possible , please also send an e-mail to nicholas ostler at < nostler @ chibcha . demon . co . uk > informing him of the hard copy submission . this is in case the hard copy does not reach its destination . this e-mail should contain the information specified in the section below . b ) electronic submission : electronic submission should be in plain ascii text email message giving the following details : # name : name of first author # title : title of the paper # email : e - mail address of the first author # addr : postal address of the first author # tel : telephone number of the first author , if any # fax : fax number of the first author and in a separate section # abstr : abstract of the paper important dates abstract submission deadline march 29 notification of committee 's decision april 27 authors submit camera-ready text july 14 conference sept 25-27 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - nicholas ostler managing director president linguacubun ltd foundation for endangered languages http : / / www . bris . ac . uk / depts / philosophy / ctll / fel / batheaston villa , 172 bailbrook lane bath ba1 7aa england + 44-1225 - 85-2865 fax + 44-1225 - 85-9258 nostler @ chibcha . demon . co . uk;Safe Email

Hi, 
   I am wondering if there are any techniques to make a CD-Key of the like 
unbreakable.  Either by giving it a cancelation date and a periodic renewal 
from a server or just by using self md5 signature on the resulting 
executable.  I know it must not be easy because the whole software piracy 
problem would be resolved but there must be some way to make it really hard 
to break it.  Anyone have hints on this issue ?Thanks- --

2082;acl workshop on translingual information management acl / coling-98 workshop on translingual information management current levels and future abilities august 16 , 1998 ( following acl / coling-98 ) university of montreal , montreal ( quebec , canada ) call for papers description - - - - - - - - - - the development of natural language applications which handle multi-lingual and multi-modal information is the next major challenge facing the field of computational linguistics . over the past 50 years , a variety of language-related capabilities has been developed in areas such as machine translation , information retrieval , and speech recognition , together with core capabilities such as information extraction , summarization , parsing , generation , multimedia planning and integration , statistics-based methods , ontologies , lexicon construction and lexical representations , and grammar . the next few years will require the extension of these technologies to encompass multi-lingual and multi-modal information . extending current technologies will require integration of the various capabilities into multi-functional natural language systems . however , there is today no clear vision of how these technologies could or should be assembled into a coherent framework . what would be involved in connecting a speech recognition system to an information retrieval engine , and then using machine translation and summarization software to process the retrieved text ? how can traditional parsing and generation be enhanced with statistical techniques ? what would be the effect of carefully crafted lexicons on traditional information retrieval ? this workshop is a follow-on to an nsf - sponsored workshop held in conjunction with the first international conference on language resources and evaluation in granada , spain ( may 1998 ) , at which an international panel of invited experts will consider these questions in an attempt to identify the most effective future directions of computational linguistics research - - especially in the context of the need to handle multi-lingual and multi-modal information . the follow-on acl workshop is intended to open the discussion to the computational inguistics community as a whole . the workshop will include ample time for discussion . a report summarizing the discussions at granada will be available before the acl workshop . topics - - - - - the workshop will focus on the following fundamental questions : 1 . what is the current level of capability in each of the major areas of the field dealing with language and related media of human communication ? 2 . how can ( some of ) these functions be integrated in the near future , and what kind of systems will result ? 3 . what are the major considerations for extending these functions to handle multi-lingual and multi-modal information , particularly in integrated systems of the type envisioned in ( 2 ) ?

( ene ) in the past two weeks , the stock is trading at about its book value , begging the question : so how much is it worth anyway ? the answer is far from easy . ever since enron metamorphosed from a stodgy gas pipeline company into what was seen by many as a dynamic energy trading firm , the company has become increasingly more difficult to understand . just a glance at the wide - range of wall street analysts who follow the company illustrates the point . in the mix are analysts who track natural gas and the pipeline industry as well as those who follow electric utilities . one enticing prospect is that the assets in its portfolio are valuable in and of themselves and could be seen by some as worthwhile acquisition targets . by enron ' s own definition , the company houses four main divisions : enron wholesale services , enron energy services , enron transportation services , and enron broadband services . wholesale services houses the company ' s energy marketing business and enrononline . this segment accounts for the bulk of enron ' s profits , and has become synonymous with what enron means to most people today . not only does enron trade gas , oil and coal , but it also trades commodities such as pulp and paper , petrochemicals , lumber , plastics and even weather risk . enron energy services is the company ' s retail arm . the company provides electricity , gas and commodity risk management services through this division . enron transportation services operates four natural gas pipelines that span about 25 , 000 miles and have a peak capacity of 9 . 8 billion cubic feet per day . through these pipelines the company says it transports about 15 % of the natural gas the u . s . needs . the segment also includes portland general , a oregon utility company enron is selling to northwest natural gas co . ( nwn ) for $ 1 . 9 billion in cash and stock . in addition , the company provides bandwidth and network services through its enron broadband services division . but enron ' s reach is even wider than this list suggests . the company also has a number of other corporate investments , including its stake in the azurix water business , enron renewable energy corp . as well as methanol and mtbe plants . through enron ' s unconsolidated affiliates , the company also has investments in additional water assets , a power plant in india and a natural gas pipeline in argentina among other things . what makes any valuation of enron difficult is what remains unknown about the company ' s financial structure . enron has yet to file a balance sheet for the third quarter , and doesn ' t expect to do so until nov . 15 , when balance sheets must be filed under securities and exchange commission regulations . without the balance sheet , some of the details needed for calculating a company ' s value are missing . also , much still remains unknown about the company ' s obligations to its off - balance sheet financing vehicles . using what is known about enron ' s finances , several analysts have arrived at their own conclusions about valuation . merrill lynch 201 - 938 - 5166 , christina . cheddar @ dowjones . com copyright ?

quarter earnings . a securities and exchange commission probe into two of the company ' s limited partnerships and a rating downgrade by moody ' s investors service haven ' t helped . john olson , an analyst at sanders morris harris , said he thought an enron takeover unlikely at this point .  however , if the stock were to keep coming down , and their financial difficulties were extended , the odds would increase ,  he said . olson pointed out that enron ' s heavy losses over the last 10 sessions partly reflects the end of the tax year for mutual funds . the calendar year for funds ends at the close of business wednesday .  mutual funds who own enron stock have been trying to offset other gains by selling off enron ,  he said .  mutual funds have to register all their gains or losses and offset them by selling or buying stock by the close today .  taking bets art smith , chairman and chief executive of the research firm john s . herold , said he ' d be surprised if enron was not entertaining offers .  it ' s one of the ways that enron gets the genie back in the bottle .  on the other hand , smith said , it would take a potential acquirer time to become comfortable with the valuation of the business .  it ' s doubtful that a potential acquirer can resolve all the valuation issues quickly ,  smith said . he said it ' s likely that any sort of purchase agreement would contain what he called a  look - back provision ,  which would protect the acquirer from being strapped to a fixed value . smith said he could see either general electric ' s ge capital or royal dutch shell making a bid . both were mentioned in the journal report .  ge capital is big enough that if it didn ' t work out it won ' t cripple ge , and they ' ve been opportunistic on things like this ,  smith said .  and shell always keeps us guessing .  olson also included aig and citigroup as potential acquirers .  enron has certainly had some appeal to people that are used to an aggressive trading culture ,  he said . smith said that even without enron , the energy marketing and trading business would continue to thrive .  even if enron went away , it would not change what has developed into a healthy market for commodity forward markets and hedging ,  he said . lisa sanders is a dallas -

' ' - - david ward and bradley keoun in san francisco usa : enron rebounds , but investors seek more disclosure . by carolyn koo 10 / 31 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . new york , oct 31 ( reuters ) - shares of enron corp . snapped back from 10 straight days of losses on wednesday after investors said the deep plunge had made the stock attractive . shares of houston - based enron , which lost more than $ 17 billion in market capitalization during the rout , surged almost 27 percent in heavy trade , making the stock second - most active on the new york stock exchange and third - biggest gainer by percentage . despite the surge , investors and analysts said they were still dissatisfied with enron ' s failure to disclose key information and said the rebound could prove short - lived for the largest trader of natural gas and power in north america .  at this level the stock is attracting money . however , the near term is not going to be good ,  said tim ghriskey , president of money managers ghriskey capital partners llc .  we don ' t own any enron . we have in the past and sold a while ago . we ' ve been tempted a couple of times during the slide , but the information flow is not that strong , and there is potential for more negative surprises .  enron closed up $ 2 . 74 , or 24 . 6 percent , to $ 13 . 90 on the nyse . the stock surged to an intraday high of $ 14 . 17 , recouping the past two days of losses , but is far from $ 33 . 84 , the closing price for enron on oct . 16 , the last day before the 10 - day tumble began . enron shares have been hammered over the past two weeks amid a series of unwelcome disclosures , including murky off - balance - sheet deals with partnerships once run by chief financial officer andrew fastow . the disclosures forced fastow ' s ouster , led to a securities and exchange commission inquiry into enron and caused at least one credit rating agency to cut enron ' s senior - debt credit status . the company said fastow ' s removal was aimed at assuaging investor concerns as the almost daily disclosures forced it to draw down about $ 3 billion from existing credit lines . trying to quantify ' worst - case scenario ' but that ' s not enough , say analysts and investors .  enron needs to substantially improve the level of disclosures ,  said nitin khandkar , a portfolio manager with dubai - based al majid investment co . , which owns enron stock .  the accounting policies it follows should not be merely legal but should also reflect the company ' s true profitability .  as an industry heavyweight ,  investors expect enron to come clean on the controversial issues ,  he said . one issue enron would do well to address is its partnerships and the liabilities they may have .  people are still struggling with trying to quantify what the worst - case scenario could be ,  said mike heim , an analyst with a . g . edwards & sons , of the existing partnerships .  instead of dismissing the worst - case scenario , i think it would make sense to mathematically show that ' here ' s what happens under such a scenario ' and then let analysts make their own assessments .  enron ' s refusal to make public its finances with greater transparency is a hallmark of arrogance , noted one academic .  the lack of transparency is an arrogance that says , ' i don ' t have to explain anything because if people don ' t want to buy my shares , they can just sit and spin , '  said paul kedrosky , a professor at the university of british columbia who sits on the board of exponentia , a company dedicated to improving communications with shareholders .  it ' s an arrogance that says , ' i do not have to disclose anything until i am forced to , '  kedrosky said .  the crucial thing is to disclose early and disclose all .  copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . waiting for balance sheets amid enron ' s debacle : david wilson 2001 - 10 - 31 16 : 39 ( new york ) ( commentary . david wilson is a columnist for bloomberg news . the opinions expressed are his own . ) princeton , new jersey , oct . 31 ( bloomberg ) - - international business machines corp . ' s press release about its third - quarter results included this statement , attributed to louis gerstner , chairman and chief executive officer : ` ` ibm ' s balance sheet remains among the strongest in the technology industry , or any industry . ' ' the largest maker of computers and provider of computer services wasn ' t the only company to cite its balance sheet , a statistical summary of what a company owned , what it owed , and what was left over for shareholders on a specific date . general electric co . , the largest company by stock market value , and citigroup inc . , the no . 1 financial - services company , made similar references in their third - quarter releases . none of the companies really showed people what they were telling them . ibm , general electric and citigroup are among 19 members of the dow jones industrial average whose most recent quarterly releases didn ' t include balance sheets . the evidence will come only when the companies submit their quarterly reports to the u . s . securities and exchange commission . balance sheets are required in the so - called 10 - q filings , along with the 10 - k filings that cover the full year . not much publicity by then , statistics about the companies ' assets , liabilities and shareholders ' equity , the accounting terms for what ' s owned , what ' s owed and what ' s left over , will be rather outdated . u . s . companies have 45 days from the end of a fiscal quarter to submit 10 - q reports , and 90 days from the end of a fiscal year for 10 - k reports . these filings usually don ' t arrive until weeks after the publication of earnings releases . so it ' s easy to overlook the additional information they provide , especially when it doesn ' t receive the kind of publicity that the earnings release does . yet the recent example of enron corp . - - another company that omits balance sheets from press releases - - provides evidence that investors who forgo the extra effort needed to find them do so at their own peril . enron , the largest energy trader , reported $ 1 . 01 billion in ` ` non - recurring ' ' costs in the third quarter from an expansion into water , telecommunications and retail - energy sales . the expense contributed to a $ 618 million loss for the quarter . these numbers were part of the houston - based company ' s income statement , a summary of sales , costs and expenses , and profits or losses during a specified time period . income statements are the cornerstone of any company ' s earnings release . billion - dollar numbers the release didn ' t even mention a larger figure that affected the balance sheet : a $ 1 . 2 billion drop in shareholders ' equity during the quarter resulting from the company ' s repurchase of 55 million shares from two partnerships , ljm cayman lp and ljm 2 co - investment lp , that helped finance projects . andrew fastow , who ran both partnerships , was ousted from his job as chief financial officer last week . chairman and ceo kenneth lay disclosed the repurchase in a subsequent conference call . such a one - two punch dealt a blow to investors ' fortunes . since oct . 17 , the day after the earnings release , enron ' s shares have fallen each day and have lost two - thirds of their value . the low of $ 10 . 90 yesterday was the lowest price since july 1992 . enron ' s third - quarter statement referred only to a loss on ` ` finance arrangements with a previously disclosed entity ' ' which contributed to $ 544 million of investment losses . the size of that item was later put at $ 35 million . the latter number amounts to just 3 . 5 percent of the overall figure for ` ` non - recurring ' ' costs , and less than 1 percent of the company ' s $ 47 . 6 billion in revenue for the quarter . growing debt burden the $ 1 . 2 billion figure is considerably larger not only in dollars , but also in percentage terms . enron had $ 11 . 74 billion of shareholders ' equity as of june 30 , according to the balance sheet in its second - quarter 10 - q filing . the reduction equaled more than 10 percent of that total . among other things , the balance sheet also shows that the company relied more heavily on debt financing during this year ' s first half . short - term debt , due in one year or less , doubled to $ 3 . 46 billion . long - term debt , maturing in more than one year , rose 9 . 4 percent to $ 9 . 36 billion . there ' s even more to the story of enron ' s indebtedness . the company guaranteed $ 3 . 3 billion in borrowing by osprey trust and marlin water trust , which bought some of its power plants . unless they pay off the debt by reselling the plants , the company may have to come up with the difference . nevertheless , any summary of a company ' s financial position provides a more complete picture than the income statement alone . this also holds true for companies whose finances are in better shape -

' ' the new york - based company had more than $ 85 billion of ` ` total equity , ' ' weill said in the statement . general electric ' s release quoted chairman and ceo jeffrey immelt as saying ` ` our strong balance sheet , which gives us the flexibility to pursue strategic opportunities , ' ' is one of the fairfield , connecticut - based company ' s ` ` fundamental strengths .

' ' enron is more likely to get a large cash infusion from an investor , wagner said . wagner has a ` ` reduce ' ' rating on enron shares . he doesn ' t own the stock . the wall street journal today said general electric co . ' s ge capital , warren buffett ' s berkshire hathaway inc . and royal dutch petroleum co . are ` ` among the names bandied about ' ' as potential buyers for all or part of enron . merrill lynch analyst donato eassey said in a report issued today that enron has a net asset value of $ 16 to $ 24 a share . he based that on a total asset value of $ 32 billion to $ 38 . 6 billion and total obligations of $ 18 . 2 billion . eassey has a ` ` near - term accumulate ' ' rating on enron ' s shares . he said enron should be considered as an investment for ` ` high - risk profile investors ' ' because of the uncertainty attached to the company . - - margot habiby in the dallas newsroom ( 214 ) 954 - 9452;Safe Email

2109;This is due to insufficient write privileges to the razor-agent.log 
file. A quick work-around is to do a chmod go+rx on that file (of 
course, it's better to restrict the access as much as possible).In Agent.pm, when the Razor2::Logger object is created, if it doesn't 
have write permission to the log file it does not succeed. Then, later 
in the code when the log object is used, it fails with the unblessed 
error.Hope this helps,

Date: Not suppliedJakob Nielsen on Offshore Usability[1]: To save costs, some companies are 
outsourcing Web projects to countries with cheap labor. Unfortunately, these 
countries lack strong usability traditions and their developers have limited 
access -- if any -- to good usability data from the target users. Offshore usability is a specific case of the general offshore design problem. 
Put simply, software teams are not successful when 
design or management are done in a different physical location than 
programming. Once I actually had a job where I was in New York, my direct 
manager was in Singapore, _his_ manager was in Hyderabad, and if I needed 
any management input I had literally no choice but to go to the CEO because at 
least he was awake during the same hours as I was. You can't get things done 
like this. A good project team relies on hundreds of small interactions a day. 
Here in the Fog Creek offices, we have 10 small conversations about FogBUGZ 3.0 
development every day. What I don't understand is people who think it's OK to move the developers ten 
time zones away from their managers and expect good results. Those same people 
would scream bloody murder if you told them that you were going to 
send the whole _management_ team to Bangalore or Beijing.[1] http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20020916.html

2144;Folks,
 
my first time posting - have a bit of Unix experience, but am new to Linux. 
Just got a new PC at home - Dell box with Windows XP. Added a second hard disk
for Linux. Partitioned the disk and have installed Suse 7.2 from CD, which went
fine except it didn't pick up my monitor.
 
I have a Dell branded E151FPp 15 LCD flat panel monitor and a nVidia GeForce4
Ti4200 video card, both of which are probably too new to feature in Suse's default
set. I downloaded a driver from the nVidia website and installed it using RPM.
Then I ran Sax2 (as was recommended in some postings I found on the net), but
it still doesn't feature my video card in the available list. What next?
 
Another problem. I have a Dell branded keyboard and if I hit Caps-Lock twice,
the whole machine crashes (in Linux, not Windows) - even the on/off switch is
inactive, leaving me to reach for the power cable instead.
 
If anyone can help me in any way with these probs., I'd be really grateful -
I've searched the 'net but have run out of ideas.
 
Or should I be going for a different version of Linux such as RedHat? Opinions
welcome.
 
Thanks a lot,
Peter--

Tech shores up Homeland DefenseComputer security is becoming an increasingly critical part of President Bush's 
proposal for a homeland defense department. When Bush formally proposed the department 
last month, he never mentioned the Internet or cybersecurity. But as Capitol Hill 
scrutinizes the proposal, politicians are fretting about tech-savvy terrorists--and 
insisting any new agency must shield the U.S. from electronic attacks as well.

system/MDA
> you're using (amavis, procmail, whatever). What exactly are you using?I am using SpamAssassin as part of the MailScanner package (using sendmail
as the MTA). It integrates nicely in there, and shares a configuration file
with SA. All very neat.> SA in itself does nothing really. You need a frontend (procmail, amavis,
etc)
> at some point in the  mail delivery chain that can hand over the message
> to SA and do whatever other processing you want.I thought that SA rated a message with a certain score, then did a certain
action (such as store  deliver  delete) based on the configuration given.
I was hoping there were some other actions that I could custom-program in.Again, many thanks,

2186;sum : size adjs and quantifiers about a month ago , i posted the following query : i ' m looking for examples , from any language , of quantifiers that are formally related to size adjectives . so far , i am familiar with the following three examples : english : little > a little lao : nohy5 > nohy5 neu : ng2 little little one  little   a little  minangkabau : ketek > saketek little one-little  little   a little  is anybody familiar with more such examples ? in spite of the typological and geographical diversity of these three languages , the above constructions are strikingly similar . this raises the following further questions : ( 1 ) are there any analogous examples where  many  is derived from  big  ? ( 2 ) are there any examples where the derivation is in the other direction , ie . where a size adjective , eg .  little  is derived from a quantifier , eg .  a few  ? * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * the above query triggered numerous interesting responses , for which i am grateful to the following residents of the global virtual village : robert beard , steven berbeco , jonathan david bobaljik , john cowan , jane edwards , f . gladney , arthur holmer , knut lambrecht , pierre larrivee , ann lindvall , edith moravcsik , geoffrey s . nathan , chris pountain , ines shaw , nancy stenson , frits stuurman , cynthia vakareliyska , 0ystein alexander vangsnes , peansiri vongvipanond , and a person who wished to remain anonymous . in a nutshell , all of the responses but one provided data from european languages . i do not know enough to say whether this areal patterning is of the phenomenon in question , or rather of the respondents to the query , and the languages that they are familiar with . however , the data suggested that formal relationships between quantifiers and size adjectives are indeed widespread , and provided an affirmative answer to the first specific query , with examples of the derivation of  many  from  big  . in what follows , i provide a selection of typical responses ( if anybody wants the responses in their entirety , they can contact me directly ) . some more examples of  little  >  a little  : swedish : liten > lite  little   a little  irish : beag > beaga ' n  little   a little  french : petit > un petit  little   a little  russian : mal / malo / mala > malo  little   a little  ( short predicate forms ) polish : maly > malo  little   a little  bulgarian : maluk / malko / malka > malko  little   a little  some respondents offered interesting diachronic comments :  [ t ] he latin adjectives for ' little ' , parvus and paulus , were replaced by what is often seen as an ' onomatopoeic ' creation ( * pittinnus for spanish ) . the adverb parum , which is morphologically related to parvus is replaced by a form * paucu , which existed in classical latin only in the plural ( pauci ) with the meaning ' ( a ) few ' . in the medieval romance languages , old spanish _ poco _ , old catalan _ poc _ and old occitan _ pauc _ are however attested in the meaning of ' little ' .  [ chris pountain ]  [ t ] he latin root is from ie * pou / pau , which gives english few , foal , as well as latin ( and english ) pauper , poverty , not to mention greek paed ` child ' ( paediatrician etc . ) so all the ` small ' and ` few ' meanings are intermingled throughout all the ie etyma .  [ geoffrey s . nathan ] and now , in response to question ( 1 ) , some examples of  big  >  many  : quebec french : gros > gros gros  big   a lot  irish : mo ' r > mo ' ra ' n  big   a lot  ( negative polarity ) polish : duzy > duzo  big   a lot  and a general diachronic comment :  slavic _ comparative _ quantifier  more  has the same root ( bol - ) as adj  big  ( old church slavonic bolii , modern russian bol 's hoj ) .  many / much  is mnogo / mnogi in the slavic languages , root * minog - ( short i ) - - there 's no etymologically related adj meaning  big  . ( the root in the comparative shows up as * bolj - in the comparative quantifier and adjs , but i am assuming the j is a suffix [ . . . ] . i think russian is the only modern language where this root still shows up in the adj .  big  , though all of them except modern bulgarian ( and probably macedonian ) still have the comparative quantifier in bol . vasmer 's etymological dictionary of the russian language relates the root to sanskrit baliyan ( acute accent on first a , long mark over i and second a ) ,  stronger  , balisthas ( acute over first a , dot under first s and t ) ,  strongest  ,  balam  ( acute over first a )  strength  . russian has two different comparative forms with this root in addition to the adj  big  ( bol 's hoj ) : comparative quantifier bol 's he ( as in  more money  ) and adverb bolee ( as in  more interesting  ) .  [ cynthia vakareliyska ] as for question ( 2 ) , pertaining to derivations in the opposite direction ( from quantifier to size adjective ) , here the evidence is still less clear . one respondent [ ann lindvall ] suggested some possible examples from swedish and greek . in fact , in the above slavic examples , the directionality is not immediately clear , and may perhaps be most appropriately characterized as a nondirectional identity of ( neuter-form ) adjective and quantifier . however , i still have n't encountered any uncontroversial examples of size adjectives that are derived from quantifiers . finally , two interesting comments on related phenomena :  hungarian : ' a little ' or 's omewhat ' ( such as in  she is a little late .  or  a somewhat over-ripe pear was lying on the table .  ) : _ kicsit _ , which consists of _ kicsi _ ( predicative form of the the adjective for 's mall ' ) plus _ t _ , the accusative marker ' very ' , ' extremely ' ( such as in the above sentences , with  little  /  somewhat  replaced with  very  /  extremely  ) : _ nagyon _ , which consists of _ nagy _ ' big ' and _ on _ , a de - adjectival adverbializer . these are ad-verbal and ad-adjectival quantifiers . adnominal quantifiers such as ' many ' and ' few ' do not have to do with size adjectives .  [ edith moravcsik ]  i suspect that the thai and lao adverb ( ? ) nak  great deal , a lot  and the adjective nak  heavy  are derivatives of one another ( strange ? ) through grammaticalization . this verbal quantifier is more prevalent in lao , lanna thai dialect and isan dialect ( all geographically and historically related ) than in bangkok thai .

software is not a product which is sold but a service which is licensed - at
least that's what I remember reading about how M$ gets away with providing
no guarantee in the U.S. If you're feeling rather deep pocketed, you could
always try suing M$ to get a court's view on the matter.

2199;a great business opportunity just for you ! hello ! about two months ago i received it again and , because of the catchy subject line , i finally read it . afterwards , i thought ,  ok , i give in , i ' m going to try this . i can certainly afford to invest $ 20 and , on the other hand , there 's nothing wrong with creating a little excess cash .  i promptly mailed four $ 5 bills and , after receiving the reports , paid a friend of mine a small fee to send out some e-mail advertisements for me . after reading the reports , i also learned how easy it is to bulk e-mail for free ! i was not prepared for the results . every day for the last six weeks , my p . o . box has been overflowing with $ 5 bills , many days the excess fills up an extra mail bin and i ' ve had to upgrade to the corporate-size box ! i am stunned by all the money that keeps rolling in ! my husband and i have been saving for several years to make a substantial downpayment on a house . now , not only are we purchasing a house with 40 % down , we ' re going to venice , italy to celebrate !

simply follow the instructions , and your dream will come true . this multi-level e-mail order marketing program works perfectly . . . 100 % every time . e - mail is the sales tool of the future . take advantage of this non-commercialized method of advertising now ! ! ! the longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using e-mail . get your piece of this action ! ! ! multi-level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and 65 % of all goods and services will be sold through multi-level methods by the mid to late 1990 's . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the u . s . , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my fingers . fortunately , sometime later i re-read everything and gave some thought and study to it . my name is christopher erickson . two years ago , the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down-sized and my position was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to open my own business . over the past year , i incured many unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends and creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just could n't seem to make ends meet . i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business . at that moment something significant happend in my life and i am writing to share the experience in hopes that this will change your life forever financially ! ! ! in mid december , i received this program via e-mail . six month 's prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . all of the programs i received , in my opinion , were not cost effective . they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not . one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one year . . . it did n't tell me i 'd have to write a book to make it ! but like i was saying , in december of 1995 i received this program . i did n't send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , i could n't believe my eyes . here was a money making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted to start , without putting me further into debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . after determining the program was legal and not a chain letter , i decided  why not .  initially i sent out 10 , 000 e-mails . it cost me about $ 15 . 00 for my time on-line . the great thing about e-mail is that i do n't need any money for printing to send out the program , only the cost to fulfill my orders . i am telling you like it is , i hope it does n't turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not  rip-off  anyone , no matter how much money it cost me ! in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by january 13 , i had received 26 orders for report # 1 . when you read the guarantee in the program , you will see that  you must receive 15-20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks . if you don ' t , send out more programs until you do !  my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 20-90 days was done . by january 30 , i had received 196 orders for report # 2 . if you go back to the guarantee ,  you must receive 100 + orders for report # 2 within 2 weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal  well , i had 196 orders for report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 19 , of my e-mailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attatched program , it will change your life forever ! ! ! remember , it won't work if you do n't try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it won't work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money ! report # 2 explains this . always follow the guarantee , 15-20 orders for report # 1 , and 100 + orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 20-90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i am sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and are if financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , christopher erickson p . s . do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it ' s awesome ! a personal note from the orginator of this program : by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for 10 years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successfull for me , but it was n't working . finally , i figured it out . it was n't me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n't have to tell you what happend to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of the poor . as the saying goes ,  the rich get richer and the poor get poorer .  the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to  move up  or  get rich  , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with  no risk  and  just a little bit of effort .  you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of this money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over 4 million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices that make this and several other programs here and over seas . by the spring we wish to market the  internet  by a partnership with america on line . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on everyone of them ! remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now !  think about it  before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! you will definitely get back what you invested . any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! paul johnson , raleigh , nc here ' s how this amazing program will make you $ $ $ $ $ let 's say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2 , 000 programs each . let 's also assume that the mailing receives a 0 . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a 0 . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those 0 . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that 's 10 , 000 $ 5 bills for you . cash ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5 , 000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of the 2 , 000 people you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program ! dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone , or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is free ! ! ! report # 3 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing and obtaining e-mail lists . instructions : we at erris mail order marketing businesses , have a method of raising capital that really works 100 % everytime . i am sure that you could use $ 50 , 000 to $ 125 , 000 in the next 20-90 days . before you say  bull . . .  , please read this program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what you do : as with all multi-level business , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi-level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come and are filled through the mail , so you are not involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : step ( 1 ) order all four ( 4 ) reports listed by name and number . do this by ordering the report from each of the four ( 4 ) names listed on the next page . for each report , send $ 5 cash and a self-addressed stamped envelope ( business size # 10 ) to the person listed for the specific report . international orders should also include $ 1 extra for postage . it is essential that you specify the name and number of the report requested to the person you are ordering it from . you will need all four ( 4 ) reports because you will be reprinting and reselling them . do not alter the names or sequence other than what the instructions say . important : always provide same-day service on all orders . step ( 2 ) replace the name and address under report # 1 with your 's , moving the one that was there down to report # 2 . drop the name and address under report # 2 to report # 3 , moving the one that was there to report # 4 . the name and the address that was under report # 4 is dropped from the list and this party is no doubt on the way to the bank . when doing this , make certain you type the names and addresses accurately ! ! ! do not mix up moving product / report positions ! ! ! step ( 3 ) having made the requested changes in the name list , save it as text ( . txt ) file in it 's own directory to be used with whatever e-mail program you like . again , report # 3 will tell you the best methods of bulk e-mailing and acquiring e-mail lists . step ( 4 ) e - mail a copy of the entire program ( all of this is very important ) to everyone whose address you can get your hands on . start with friends and relatives since you can encourage them to take advantage of this fabulous money-making opportunity . that 's what i did . and they love me now , more than ever . then , e-mail to anyone and everyone ! use your imagination ! you can get e-mail addresses from companies on the internet who specialize in e-mail mailing lists . these are very cheap , 100 , 000 addresses for around $ 35 . important : you won't get a good response if you use an old list , so always request a fresh , new list . you will find out where to purchase these lists when you order the four ( 4 ) reports . always provide same-day service on all orders ! ! ! required reports : * * * order each report by number and name * * * always send a self-addressed , stamped envelope and $ 5 cash for each order requesting the specific report by name and number . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 1  how to make $ 250 , 000 through multi-level sales  order report # 1 from : kathy smith 5312 s . e . 30 ave ocala , fl 34480-7524 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 2  major corporations and multi-level sales  order report # 2 from : micro info publishing inc . 2107 w . commonwealth ave . dept . 264 alhambra , ca 91803 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 3  sources for the best mailing lists  order report # 3 from : som co . 2168 s . atlantic blvd . # 101 monterey park , ca 91754 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 4  evaluating multi-level sales plans  order report # 4 from : kal inc . p . o . box 2433 glenview , il . 60025-2433 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ conclusion : i am enjoying my fortune that i made by sending out this program . you too , will be making money in 20-90 days , if you follow the simple steps outlined in this mailing . to be financially independent is to be free . free to make financial decisions as never before . go into business , get into investments , retire or take a vacation . no longer will a lack of money hold you back . however , very few people reach financial independence , because when opportunity knocks , they choose to ignore it . it is much easier to say  no  than  yes  , and this the question that you must answer . will you ignore this amazing opportunity or will you take advantage of it ? if you do nothing , you have indeed missed something and nothing will change . please re-read this material , this is a special opportunity . if you have any questions , please feel free to write to the sender of this information . you will get a prompt and informative reply . my method is simple . i sell thousands of people a product for $ 5 that cost me pennies to produce and e-mail . i should also point out that this program is legal and everyone who participates will make money . this is not a chain letter or a pyramid scam . at times you probably received chain letters , asking you to send money , on faith , but getting nothing in return , no product what-so - ever ! not only are chain lettters illegal , but the risk of someone breaking the chain makes them quite unattractive . you are offering a legitimate product to your people . after they purchase the product from you , they reproduce more and resell them . it 's simple free enterprise . as you learned from the enclosed material , the product is a series of four ( 4 ) financial and business reports . the information contained in these reports will not only help you in making your participation in this program more rewarding , but will be useful to you in any other business decisions you make in the years ahead . you are also buying the rights to reprint all of the reports , which will be ordered from you by those to whom you mail this program . the concise one and two page reports you will be buying can easily be reproduced at a local copy center for a cost of about 3 cents a copy . best wishes with the program and good luck !;Phishing Email

2201;mg var results for the 27 th july hi , i have run the var with updated factor loadings for the gold , silver and cocoa bean positions . the biggest change in var from adding this information has been to the cocoa bean position which has increased from approx $ 45 , 900 to $ 506 , 553 . the overal var has not changed by very much as the position file i was sent from andreas had not changed from the 26 th - i have queried this and it will not be a problem to re - run the numbers on monday if i recieve a further file . the var summary for all the metals is as follows : also , after having a conversation with bjorn about stress / scenario analysis i thought i might quickly try to set up a few scenarios to see how sensitive the var is to a position change in aluminium , nickel and copper . i have only applied position increases ( thge direction of the shifts are dependent on the monthly outright position direction ) up until dec 2000 . the shifts and results are given in the following attached spreadsheet . it is interesting that the individual var ' s are particuarly sensitive to increasing the position for nickel . i would like to discuss these results on monday and any further suggestions for senarios would also be gratefully recieved . have a good weekend , kirstee .;Safe Email

2209;optimal artificial languages ( humour ) there has been a bit ( wee ) of discussion on this on sci . lang and , well , i could not resist the temptation . here is my contribution to the topic : > from jbm @ newsserver . trl . oz . au ( jacques guy ) date 27 jan 1995 15 : 29 : 06 + 1100 newsgroups sci . lang subject re : optimal artificial languages language being for communication ( not necessarily of truths , mark my words ) , an optimal artificial language should be designed so that its messages survive unscathed through the worst static . ergo , we want * maximal phonetic differentiation * ( tm ) of the vowels , we pick those maximally distant : a , i , u . of the consonants , ditto : a dental , a labial , a velar . having picked the most differentiated points of articulation we must also pick the most deifferentiated manners thereof . fricative , nasal , stop should do nicely . and let us use voicing to help along . that leaves us with * three maximally distant consonants * , which are : m , z , k . so far , so good . but we can do better still . let each consonant be associated with one , and only one , vowel , so that , if either consonant or vowel manages to get mangled in the transmission , you can restitute one from the other . naturally , we would match vowels and consonants to ensure least articulatory effort , lest speakers , tired by too much tongue and lip shifting , start slurring their words . there are n't two ways about it : i goes with z , u with m , a with k . so there we have it , the perfect language for noise-free communication . it 's cv , no consonant clusters , no diphthongs , and each syllable starts with exactly one consonant and has only one vowel . if the consonant is z the vowel is i , and so on ( how lazy can one get ! the list of possibilities is short indeed , yet i wrote  and so on  ) . ergo , it has only three possible syllables : zi , ka , mu , thereby being some 130 times easier than chinese ( with its 400 + possible syllables ) . and consider this sample vocabulary ( i leave the meanings to your imagination ) : zizi kaka mumu zizimu kakamu infants will learn it easily ! consider all its advantages : your children will speak fluently before they are two ! one of the first , because shortest , words they will learn will be . . . . . muzika ! thus ensuring the earliest possible development of their musical aptitude ! promote zikamu ( tm ) , the international language of to-morrow ! nb it has come to our attention that a renegade splinter group of the original zikamu ( tm ) movement is peddling a pale imitation of zikamu ( tm ) under the plagiarized name  kazimu  . do not be deceived ! the study and practice of their inferior product may cause brain damage ! insist on learning the one and only zikamu ( tm ) . join the official , approved zikamu foundation ( tm ) to day !

InDigiNet Identifies 
Acquisition Targets with Combined Revenues of $35 Million...
Â 
Telecom Consolidation Begins to Accelerate The Wall Street Bulletin believes 
that the recent 
investment of capital into Level 3, lead by Warren Buffett, 
is further proof of the continued validity of the telecommunication 
market when looked at from the perspective of the small to mid-sized 
enterprises. After the boom and bust comes the revival. For some 
carriers drowning in debt, such as Global Crossing and WorldCom, 
the future may be dim. But for those survivors of the industry 
that have managed to remain on their feet, other companies' problems 
mean opportunity. Every major industry in the history of 
the United States has experienced a similar transformation, from 
the railroads in the late 1800s to the automakers in the mid-1900s 
to the Dot-Coms at the end of the 20th century, says Robert 
Saunders, director of the Eastern Management Group market 
research firm. Christopher 
Dean, CTO of OSS company Eftia, says We are seeing all 
the people that are the survivors. There's all this pent-up money 
and for the surviving carriers out there, they can get what used 
to cost a few billion for a few millions. Read the full 
story from Telecommunications Magazine - See the link at the end 
of this newsletter. 
As we write this report, our New Recommendation 
InDigiNet, Inc. (OTCBB: 
IGTT) has only been trading on the OTC Bulletin Board since 
late May of 2002. As InDigiNet, Inc. continues to implement its 
business plan, we believe this company will help lead the way 
up for the resurgence of the Telecom Sector. This could be our 
strongest recommendation of the year. We are giving IGTT our Highest 
Rating of STRONG BUY/AGGRESSIVE GROWTH.
Â 
Ground Floor Opportunity / Tremendous 
Growth Potential 
We believe IGTT will perform equally to, if not 
greater than its competition. A similar telecommunications company, 
Talk America Holdings (Nasdaq: TALK), share 
price began to explode in April of this year moving from just 
over $0.40/share to over $4.00/share in late June. Talk America 
Holdings previously had a market cap of only $24.51 million, but 
today has a market cap of $267 million.
IGTT curently has a market cap of $22.42 million. 
Using the TALK model for potential growth, IGTT could very well 
be trading in the .60 range in only a few months, with a market 
cap in excess of $250 million. This would be an increase of 1000%. 
So you see why IGTT has such great potential and the time is right 
 for investors to get in on the ground floor.
Â 
The InDigNet Strategy
InDigiNet, Inc. is an integrated solutions company 
that provides small to mid-sized enterprises (SMEs) with an integrated 
communication solution. InDigiNet is a prestigious Diamond 
level partner of Avaya, as well as a reseller for Cisco and 
Compaq. The Company will offer data, local, long distance and 
wireless services to SMEs over third party networks enabling the 
Company to offer a comprehensive suite of services without the 
capital burden of building a communication network. The Companyâ€™s 
strategy is to acquire the customer bases of smaller, single market 
communication companies and attractively priced Internet 
Service Providers (ISPs). The Company recently completed 
its acquisitions of Fox Telecommunications and WBConnect. 
InDigiNet will then expand the breadth of their services to grow 
revenue and enhance profitability. SMEs account for $120 billion 
in commercial telephony, data services and technology spending, 
or 33% of the countryâ€™s total market, and this spending 
is expected to grow at above average rates over the next ten years.

The IT Market
Based on recent studies, the countryâ€™s 7.4 
million SMEs currently lag significantly in the utilization of 
IT and data 
communications, including Internet access, web services, business 
software and e-commerce. Worldwide IT spending increased to $981 
billion US for the year, an overall increase of 3.7 percent over 
2001, according to a study released 7/24/2002 by market researcher 
IDC. IT spending in 2003 is expected to reach record heights, 
growing by 9 percent worldwide to top the $1 trillion mark for 
the first time. In IDC's revised forecasts for IT spending in 
2002 and 2003, IT spending in the US is expected to increase by 
3 percent this year over 2001 to $436 billion, with further growth 
of 9 percent in 2003. Western Europe can expect growth of 4 percent 
in 2002 and 6 percent in 2003. Though Japan will experience flat 
growth levels this year, by next year growth in the market will 
return to the tune of 7 percent with particular strength shown 
in China, India, Korea, Russia, the Philippines, South Africa 
and Poland. Source: IDC
Â 
Particulars
The Wall Street Bulletin is putting IGTT on our 
Strong Buy/Aggressive Growth recommendation list for the following 
reasons:
1. The Company's strategy is to acquire the customer 
bases of smaller, single-market communication companies and attractively 
priced Internet Service Providers (ISPs). The Company will sell 
its bundled service package to the acquired customer base that 
will form a direct and immediate distribution channel for all 
types of communication services - local, long distance, wireless, 
and data. 2. The Company is currently serving many customers in the Denver/Front 
Range communities but in particular the education vertical market 
has recognized the value of integrating a wireless broadband data 
network into the existing campus network. The Company's customers 
include United States Olympic Committee 
(USOC), University of Denver, 
and Colorado State University. 
3. The Company has identified approximately $35,000,000 in revenues 
to acquire comprised of distressed assets to be auctioned in bankruptcy 
court and smaller communication providers with valuable customer 
bases. Each of the targeted companies are within the Company's 
footprint and will, subject to purchase completion, increase the 
Company's embedded customer base. 
Â 
Investment Consideration
InDigiNet Inc recently filed its 10QSB, for the 
three months ended March 31, 2002. IGTT reported Revenues of $339,694 
in Q1 2002 vs. Revenues of $0 in Q1 2001. At this current growth 
rate, revenues should grow above $1.3 million for their first 
year of production with no increases in acquisitions. As more 
and more large corporations come under government scrutiny, investors 
will turn to small to mid-sized companies with their investment 
dollars.
